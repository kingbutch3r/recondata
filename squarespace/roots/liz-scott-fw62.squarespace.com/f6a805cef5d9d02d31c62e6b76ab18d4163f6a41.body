So I'll start where I always do, with books.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us first begin by reviewing my reading goals for the year. If you'll recall, I set out the year with some pretty <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/1/2/the-year-in-reading-2016">lofty literary ambitions.</a> How'd I do?? Honestly pretty terribly!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1) Less Aimless, Pointless Scrolling:</strong> Proud to share that if anything I have <em>regressed</em>&nbsp;on this front, still dedicating hours upon hours a week to looking at strangers' kitchens and babies on the internet. Better luck in 2018?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2) More Diverse Authors:</strong> Of 55 books I read this year, 41 were by women, 17 were by writers of color and I'd love to pretend I did put in an effort to seek out other areas of diversity - i.e. sexuality, gender identity, physical ability, but much like my scrolling goaling...good intentions, poor follow through.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3) Read More For Work: </strong>last year I read 12 books on our annual list and this year I read <strong>*13!* </strong>I dropped the ball so hard everywhere else, I'm chalking this one up to a W.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4) Nonfiction Challenge: </strong>This was the biggie. If you recall, I set out with the intention to read one work of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/2/6/hottreads-2017-nonfiction-reading-challenge">social justice nonfiction a month</a>. That endeavor started with a real bang - bringing 2 of my top 5 of the year! - but pretty quickly crumbled in April, when I couldn't find my copy of The New Jim Crow and then life got kind of bonkers overall and I really thought I made it 4 months but upon reflecting today, I see it was just 3.&nbsp;</p><p>GOOD JOB LIZ!</p><p>So if I wasn't reading work-assigned social justice nonfiction by black transwomen...what <em>was</em>&nbsp;I reading? Let's take a look.</p><p>As I mentioned, I clocked 55 books this year - just squeaking over one a week. 42 were novels, 1 short story collection (for work!)... and I've also been savoring stories from Carmen Maria Machado's <em><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781555977887">Her Body and Other Parties</a> </strong></em>for the past month (and loving!) but haven't technically finished - so maybe let's say 53 1/2 books, 1.5 story collections. Of the remaining 12 works of non-fiction, there were the three aforementioned big nonfiction books + two other books that would technically fall under this category, but I read for work so won't count in my challenge, 3 memoirs, and 3 (excellent!) essay collections, and surprisingly only <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Expecting-Better-Conventional-Pregnancy-Wrong/dp/0143125702">one book</a> on pregnancy. Our OBGYN warned us that most books on pregnancy are written to terrify expectant parents and as someone having a very hard time managing their pregnancy anxiety (...more on <em>that</em>&nbsp;to come), I've heeded her advice and avoided the genre altogether. And in possibly the most shocking turn of events, only 10 would fall under the thriller category, down from 12 last year and most of them were perfectly fine. I'll elaborate on a few later but if there was one hole in this year's list it was a pin you to your chair, brain-twisting thriller.&nbsp;</p><p>I set out on my month long sabbatical with a list of titles I thought were recommended by a particular friend, but when I brought them up to her post-trip, she hadn't read any of them, so lord only knows who suggested these books to me. Here's what I did read on that trip: <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316272483"><em>Little Deaths</em> </a>by Emma Flint,</strong> a thriller I'd been looking forward to that ultimately let me down; <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780618526413"><em>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</em></a> by Carson McCullers,</strong> which was beautiful but terribly sad and not much of a vacation read...but I'm glad I read it; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780345803788"><em><strong>Crazy</strong></em></a><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780345803788"><em>&nbsp;Rich Asians</em> </a>by Kevin Kwan,</strong> the first of the trilogy which was pure nonsense in a very good way; <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316012836"><em>When Will There Be Good News</em> </a>by Kate Atkinson</strong>, which I'll get into later; and <strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812975406">American Wife</a> </em>by Curtis Sittenfeld</strong> which I <em>liked</em>&nbsp;but didn't love...maybe 2017 just wasn't the year for stories about intelligent women falling for the so-called charms of childish, conservative politicians. Ahem.&nbsp;</p><p>I also re-read two books this year, which I don't often do. The first was<strong> Arundhati Roy's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812979657"><em>The God of Small Things</em></a>,</strong> revisited in anticipation of her new novel, which I never actually go around to reading. But SO worth the re-read. I'd initially purchased and read this novel somewhere in Europe while studying abroad - I was v into buying award-winning novels at used bookstores during that juncture of my life, as part of my whole chic international student aesthetic - and I was always underlining phrases that stood out to me and it's painfully hilarious to go back and see what touched me as a faux-intellectual 21 year old. Usually they're the corniest lines in the book but much to my surprise, everything that wowed me from this novel a decade (...and change) ago totally stuck. Roy has a way with words and phrases unlike anyone I've ever read and the story was all the richer reading with more mature eyes. Highly recommend this one if you've yet to read!&nbsp;</p><p>The other novel I reread was <strong>Judy Blume's</strong> masterpiece<strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385337663"><em>Summer Sisters</em></a> </strong>which is flaming, beautiful, glorious trash. I first discovered this book the summer after 8th grade when I was babysitting my cousin Dani as a summer job. I had heard about the book and how scandalous it was, so every day I'd pull it off the shelf and read a few pages and then put it back right where I found it, not wanting my aunt to know I was reading it,&nbsp;and it was so shocking and dirty and of course I loved it and I think that really ignited my lifelong appreciation for books with lots of sexy parts. Thanks, Judy Blume! I also recommend this one, if you have like 3 hours to kill on a summer afternoon, maybe with a glass of wine, in the tub, light a few candles? I don't know, ladies, live your best lives!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;You know it's basically impossible for me to pick a favorite book, but since you asked (no one asked), here is a rough top 5 from the year, in order of however they popped into my head just now:&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1514665385068_114188"><div class="sqs-block-content">

It's a rich, sprawling story of a well to-do family in Shaker Heights, OH and the mother-daughter duo who come into their lives and shake up the family's perfect facade. Bonus points for the 1998 setting with flawlessly on-the-nose period details, including Puff Daddy songs, bad fashion, and brown lip liner.</p><p><strong>2) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780553447453"><em>Evicted</em></a> by Matthew Desmond</strong>: Assuming you've all read this already, based on my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/2/1/hottreads">glowing review</a> all the way back in January, but in case you haven't...hop to. And book <strong>2b,</strong> basically same deal = <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812984965"><em>Just Mercy </em></a>by Bryan Stevenson,</strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/4/4/fnb6rffxocknmsnnkbwzkpeukhk3a6"><strong> </strong>review right hurr. </a>Don't let my nonfiction failure be <em>your</em>&nbsp;nonfiction failure. These books still haunt me lo these months later. Lo these whole many months!!</p><p><strong>3) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101912195"><em>We Are Never Meeting in Real Life</em></a> by Samantha Irby:</strong> I've been obsessed with Samantha for years since first discovering her blog <a target="_blank" href="http://bitchesgottaeat.blogspot.com/">Bitches Gotta Eat</a>, and this summer I excitedly purchased her book as a gift for myself and carried her along as a solo date companion, first to the pedicure chair, and then to a neighborhood restaurant where I sat and dined, alone, on the patio, under an awning as a summer storm rained down around me and I laughed and I cried and I marveled at just how brilliantly Samantha does all that I wish I could do, drawing you into a funny story before hitting you with a gut punch of vulnerability and tragedy. The first essay in this collection, a self-intro to the author's life as a poor, black, plus-sized woman by way of a Bachelorette application is a goddamn master class in personal essay writing. I literally just re-read it right now for funsies and yep, still perfect. PERFECT.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4)<a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812984460"> <em>Idaho</em></a><em> </em>by Emily Ruskovich: </strong>Slipping in just under the 2017 wire, I finally picked up this book just last week, after having it on my TBR for a full year. It was first recommended to me by Paula Hawkins, author of the international smash bestsellers <em>The Girl on the Train </em>and <em>Into the Water,</em> (did you guys know I talk to famous authors like, all the time? #brag), who is not only one of my favorite writers, but one of the smartest and best readers I know. I don't know why it took me so long to get to this, but it kind of came to me at just the right moment, as I needed a truly stand-out book to pull me out of a lull of meh stuff. Idaho is the story of a woman living in a remote mountain town, trying to piece together what happened to her husband's first wife and daughters, before he loses his memory to early-onset dementia. It skirts the line of the psychological thriller but is so, so much more. It's dark and beautiful and unlike anything I've read before. (Side note: whenever I read the author's name, I confuse her with<a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/emrata/?hl=en"> this hot chick </a>and am like, wow that music video girl really has a lot of layers to her, but I do believe they are actually two different people??)</p><p><strong>5) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501144370"><em>Girl in Snow</em></a> by Danya Kukafka:</strong> This is cheating because I read it last year, but it came out in 2017 and this is my list, I do what I want! Full disclosure: Danya is my friend. Fuller disclosure: Her book is amazing, and you know wouldn't lie to ya if I didn't legit love it.&nbsp;The story of a small town in Colorado rocked by the death of a popular teen, it's <em>The Lovely Bones</em> + Megan Abbott + Danya's own brilliant voice. We all know it's a sign if a book makes me cry on the subway and good news, this one had me weeping on the F train.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Honorable Mentions: </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780061763496"><em>Heat and Light</em> </a>by Jennifer Haigh (a sprawling, epic novel set in PA coal country, complete with plenty of Sheetz name-drops); <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780143109273">The Association of Small Bombs</a> </em>by Karan Mahajan (two brother killed by a bomb blast in a Delhi market and the aftershocks on those involved);<a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062419385"><em> It's Okay to Laugh (Crying is Cool Too) </em></a>by Nora McInierny (beautiful, funny, sad essays by another favorite blogger);<em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735221710">What We Lose</a> </em>by Zinzi Clemmons (structurally unique, exploration of grief by a young writer I'm excited to see more from);<em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062563668">The Women in the Castle</a></em> by Jessica Shattuk (A+ historical fiction about women coming together in post-WWII Germany);&nbsp;<em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780802127389">History of Wolves</a> </em>by Emily Friedlund +<a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735213005"> </a><em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735213005">The Marsh King's Daughter</a> </em>by Karin Dionne (theme of this year was young women fending for themselves in the Minnesota wilderness. Two very different, but equally compelling novels of self-discovery, violence, and terrible parenting against the backdrop of the icy north); <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062498533">The Hate U Give</a> </em>by Angie Jackson (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/4/4/fnb6rffxocknmsnnkbwzkpeukhk3a6">review here!</a>); and, as teased,<strong>&nbsp;<em>When Will There Be Good News </em>by Kate Atkinson,</strong> which narrowly missed the Top 5 list only because it's part of a series so here's when I tell you to read Kate's Jackson Brodie mystery series, beginning with <em>Case Histories</em>. I adore this smart, sprawling, darkly funny detective novels set in England and Scotland, and realized I read one installment a year. <em>When Will There Be Good News</em>, book 3 of 4, may be my favorite yet.</p><p>And that, my fine friends, was 2017, by the books.</p><p>I'm powering full speed ahead into next year's list. I just began<a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781455563920"><em> <strong>Pachinko </strong></em></a><strong>by Min Jin Lee </strong>and have been dipping into <strong>Gabrielle Union's</strong> (delightful!) memoir <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062693983"><em>We're Going to Need More Wine</em></a> </strong>every evening before bed. As for my foals for the coming 365 days, I'm keeping it and keeping it simple this year:</p><p>1) Less Aimless, Pointless Scrolling (FOR REAL THIS TIME)</p><p>2) Somehow Maintain a Habit of Reading for Pleasure and Work Whilst Also Keeping a Human Baby Alive*</p><p>The end! As always, I'd love to hear your top books of 2017 or what you're planning to read next! Here's to another year of HottReading and, if I'm being optimistic...the reemergence of the ol' blog?! We shall see!</p><p>Happy New Year!</p><p>Liz Ho</p><p>* If somehow you read this blog, but don't follow me on social media, I am indeed great with child, due May 5. Oh. Em.

In spite of the heat and the mosquitoes, the smell of steaming garbage lingering over the city, August is always my favorite month. I like the long days and dramatic sunsets - and the dramatic thunderstorms, too, even when they wake me up at 6 AM like they did today.&nbsp;</p><p>August is when we were married and, thanks to Brian's teaching schedule, when we're both able to sneak away on vacation, so to me, the month always feels like romance and grand adventures. &nbsp;</p><p>And August 2017 is shaping up to be a highlight on both fronts - in addition to celebrating our third wedding anniversary on the 16th, I'm celebrating my tenth (10th) (!) work anniversary with my company which is absolutely mindboggling considering I'm pretty sure I just graduated college like, last week. I so vividly remember my first day, I was 22, fresh out of college and living with a friend's parents in a suburb just north of the city. I was so worried about being late, that I took a 7 AM train just in case, and ended up with an hour to kill before I was due at HR. It was pouring rain (just like today!) and muggy as all get-out, and I whiled away the hour at a Starbucks next to the office, ticking through the final countdown until my Real Adult Life began. As soon as I heard I got the job, my mom and I raced to The Limited to revamp my wardrobe with outfits we imagined a Big City Publishing Gal might wear and so on day one I was sporting this chic camel pencil skirt, a short-sleeved black sweater, and pointy toed black pumps because hello, 2007. I would quickly learn that publishing dress code was far less glam than what the television would imply and that may well have been both the first and last time I rocked that pencil skirt. My mom insisted that I wear pantyhose despite the heat and the fact that it was, again, the year 2007 not 1957, because a lady simply can not walk into a professional office with bare legs. I thought it overkill, but wore them anyway. Even 100 miles away on the cusp of my own adult life, I listen to my mother. By the time I got into the city they were soaked through from the rain and the humidity and all of my anxious sweating, so I took them off in the ladies room at the Starbucks and threw them in the trash and now every time I go into that Starbucks, which is often, it's still there, I think of stuffing my stockings in the garbage and it makes me laugh. And they've kept me on for a full decade, so I guess bare legs probably isn't such a drastic offense.</p><p>But we should all still listen to our mothers!&nbsp;</p><p>I have one million more thoughts on this milestone in my life, which perhaps I'll share with you someday - I <em>have</em>&nbsp;been writing quite a bit this summer, though I haven't felt ready to post any of it quite yet...asking the age-old proverbial question: if a blogger writes but doesn't share it, does her keyboard make a clicking sound?&nbsp;</p><p>But all of those thoughts will have to wait until at least September, because this girl is going off the grid!&nbsp;</p><p>My company has incredible HR benefits, for which I am deeply grateful, not least of which being their milestone sabbatical program. After ten years on the payroll, all employees are granted a four-week sabbatical in addition to their existing vacation days. It's <em>such </em>a gift and has always felt like this mythical unicorn on the horizon drawing closer year by year and suddenly it's here, it's here, it's HERE.</p><p>At 9:05 PM this evening I jet off for a month of adventure!</p><p>First, three weeks in the Pacific Northwest with Bri-guy, visiting Seattle, Olympic National Park, Vancouver, and San Juan Island where we will hike, kayak, eat seafood, drink microbrews, and perchance even...<em>relax</em>?! We're pretty skeptical,&nbsp;too, but stranger things have happened!</p><p>Then, B flies home for the start of the fall semester (sucka), and I fly to Salt Lake City where I'm meeting up with one of my best best besties smack dab in the middle of a sabbatical trip she is taking from her own (different) company. From SLC we'll truck down for a few days in the Grand Canyon, where we'll be camping (yikes) and then so long as we are not eaten by bears or murdered by serial killers (two things that definitely happen when sleeping in a tent), we venture up to Zion National Park. At Zion we're staying in a "Ranch Resort" which has different lodging options, including tents and cabins and a few cabins kitsched out to look like covered wagons and we are staying in one of the wagons and I just feel like my whole life has been working towards this moment. I don't know if I've ever conveyed this via the blog, but in my youth I was V into the pioneer lifestyle - I dressed as Laura Ingalls Wilder for at least one Halloween, spent hours playing Oregon Trail, owned many books about the Donner Party - and sleeping in a covered wagon is pretty much a dream come true for me.&nbsp;</p><p>And now it's happening!</p><p>I have been looking forward to this trip for so long, now that it's here I want time to slow to an absolute crawl. I want this August to last forever.</p><p>I'm going to attempt to learn to unplug a pinch - I removed Outlook from my phone, I'm deleting Facebook, Twitter, and unsubscribing from all of my newsletters, which asks another age-old proverbial question: if Trump tweets and you ignore it because you're too busy frolicking in a Northwestern rain forest to care...is he still president?</p><p>Let's just say no. I'm taking a sabbatical from work <em>and</em>&nbsp;reality.</p><p>I won't be going fully off the grid, however, and will continue posting to Instagram, because I enjoy having a place to collect photographic memories and, let's be real, need those likes to survive. @LizHo914, #hottsabbatical. See you there!</p><p>Ok, I must hurry off to finish packing and get my nails done because nothing says "outdoorsy" quite like a fresh pedicure.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you have some August adventures up your sleeves, too. Happy summer!</p><p>Xoxo,&nbsp;</p><p>Liz Hott, former high-stress NYC literary publicist, future laid-back Pacific coast oyster farmer&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

So recently I found myself in a big, chaotic gathering amid a lot of people who don't know me all that well, namely my brother's wedding weekend, and one of these relative strangers, namely his new mother-in-law, said to my new sister-in-law (stay with me here) that she thinks I'm very, and I quote: "laid back and go-with-the-flow."</p><p>Wait, what? Who?&nbsp;<em>This</em>&nbsp;Liz?</p><p>It was obviously not something I'd heard much before, so I jokingly brought it up to a few people who do know me better and they all...confirmed it.

Who knew?&nbsp;</p><p>This off-hand conversation has led me on a -Trigger Warning for Oprah Language! - personal growth journey. It's interesting to consider how the ways we see ourselves might differ from the way others see us. Perhaps if I can begin to recognize my multitudes, I won't be as hard on myself in those instances when I am well, <em>not breezy. </em>Perhaps I could begin to appreciate myself for the times I do, actually, go with the flow while letting myself off the hook for the times I don't. It's possible that I'm not the uptight control monster I always envisioned but just a layered individual who can, on occasion, be a little tightly wound.&nbsp;</p><p>Though I was, apparently, really leaning into my breezy side while feting the newlyweds a few weeks back (and yes, I'll go ahead and say what you're all thinking, I <em>am</em>&nbsp;making my brother's wedding weekend all about me...I haven't personally grown <em>that</em>&nbsp;much yet),&nbsp;the ensuing weeks have hurled me in the opposite direction and I've felt myself winding tighter and tighter until like a spring, I'm ready to snap.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not like, hovering on the edge of a breakdown or anything, don't worry, but I am maybe not being the best me I can be. &nbsp;Thanks to a spicy mix of high pressure work projects, dumb personal life stuff, and this continued knee injury, which has left me unable to run, thus providing me with an extra thing to stress about while effectively wiping out my #1 coping mechanism, I've been feeling like a hot mess express. I need to chill out...and fast.</p><p>I decided to take the proverbial bull by the horns if you will (I have no idea what that phrase even means) this past weekend and treat myself to a massage, hoping it would loosen some shit up, physically and emotionally.&nbsp;I have only had one massage ever in my life, in Cambodia and I would not say it was a stellar experience. I mean, the masseuse was great but I was, as always a total spaz, and spent the entire time stressing about class issues and thinking about boners. You can read that whole saga<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2015/5/26/p8bj39opv5ddn7gybve20xz67j483w?rq=cambodia"> riiight here</a>. But desperate times call for desperate measures so I boldly made an appointment for Sunday afternoon at the wellness clinic down the street where I have occasionally visited for acupuncture. I mean! I've been so calm and normal during<em> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/1/8/oyyjxrnqijab1rens9oiqkbfepc346?rq=acup">those </a></em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/1/8/oyyjxrnqijab1rens9oiqkbfepc346?rq=acup">appointments,</a> just think of how relaxed I'll be laying there fully nude while a stranger massages my armpits.</p><p>Yes, armpits.</p><p>Mid-massage the masseuse started going <em>in</em>&nbsp;on that area of fat that hangs over strapless dresses no matter how many half-assed push ups you do (ladies know what I'm talkin' about) and advised that I ask Brian to massage me in the same location. What? I can't. I have, god-willing, 50+ years of keeping the mystery alive here, we are NOT in the armpit massage stage of marriage just yet.&nbsp;</p><p>But the pits weren't even the worst of it. APPARENTLY I am even more tightly wound that I thought and here are all of the places I hold tension: back, hips, ankles, glutes, mid-torso, shoulder blades, neck, pits, and <em>especially </em>forearms. What! How are even my <em>forearms</em>&nbsp;stressed? The masseuse did do something wonderful that made my hands feel all loose and wiggly and then asked me how big my office was. "Big enough!" I replied, thinking he was going to advise me on some stretches. Instead he offered me one takeaway: buy a hot towel warmer from the internet and wrap my forearms in warm towels every time I begin to feel stressed.</p><p>Again: no.</p><p>LOVE your enthusiasm, bud, but I am never going to purchase and install a hot towel warmer in my office I just don't think that's how the real world works. And as routinely demonstrated, I am so deeply neurotic AT ALL TIMES, this just ends with me fully draped in hot towels like I'm Andre Agassi after a rough match at Wimbledon.&nbsp;</p><p>But, all things considered, the massage was actually great and did help to bust some kinks out of my back and I would for sure do it again. And next time, I might even come prepared with cash!</p><p>That's right. Superfans of Ye Olde Hott Sauce will surely recall that I left my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2016/9/8/739p7v7y8ej1n0lg5pri57o0pwxu6x?rq=acupunc">first acupuncture experience</a> at this clinic in a total panic after seeing a tip envelope, unsure of the protocol on tipping for these sorts of services. Post massage I dressed and languorously made my way to the front desk only to again be instantly snapped out of my relaxed reverie by the sight of those damn tiny envelopes. Acupuncture is a grey area but massage surely falls under the tippage category of physical services.&nbsp;</p><p>I paid for my appointment with my credit card and, nervously looking around the room, sucked up my pride and in a loud whisper asked the very nice young woman behind the desk "can I ask you an important question?"</p><p>"Of course!" she replied politely.</p><p>"This is so embarrassing but...are you supposed to tip? For a massage, I mean? I've only ever been to acupuncture and..."</p><p>She cut me off with a kind but chastising all the same: "for massage, it is customary. And we do only take tips in cash."</p><p>KEWL.</p><p>Here's how much cash I had on my person: zero dollars and zero cents.&nbsp;</p><p>I gave a frenzied laugh, yelped "OK I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!", and sprinted out into the day in search of some dolla bills. All along my plan for the afternoon had been to go to the massage and then do my grocery shopping at the big, reasonably priced grocery store three blocks from clinic, in the opposite direction from my apartment. As I came out of the massage place in search of some cash, I decided I didn't want to spend $2.50 on bodega ATM fees, so my best option was to walk to the CVS which is directly next to said grocery store and get some cash back. I should have just done my grocery shopping at this time, but decided it would be too weird to go back to the clinic carrying all of my groceries, so instead I purchased one solitary paper towel roll at CVS and took out $40 cash back and hiked the three blocks - uphill, mind you! - back to the massage place. I know you're thinking that is a very generous tip for one massage and you are right but I wanted to be prepared just in case. You see, I'd never actually tipped for my few acupuncture appointments and decided as long as I was already embarrassing myself, I'd just ask the front desk gal what the protocol was on that front and, if needed, leave some kind of retroactive tip to atone for my sins.&nbsp;</p><p>Formal confirmation for the equally confused: massage = tip. Acupuncture = "considered a medical practice" = no tip. The more you know!</p><p>Once again I found myself leaving an appointment intended to help me relax even <em>more </em>stressed than when I first begin.&nbsp;</p><p>Exhausted by it all, I decided I did not have the energy to walk all the way back to the cheap grocery store and instead just visited the smaller, v bougie grocery store a block away from my apartment, effectively cancelling out any and all savings I'd accrued by avoiding bodega ATM fees, and then some.&nbsp;</p><p>Shopping alongside me was a rumpled older gentleman - picture the drunk uncle character on SNL Weekend Update and give him a bushier beard - who was muttering a grouchy monologue throughout his shopping, lamenting the high price of groceries these days, the rents, the pesticides.</p><p>"You just can't afford to live in this town anymore!" he groused to his lettuce. "The rents will kill you, if the chemicals don't first," under his breath while pawing through a stack of carrots. Then louder: "FIVE DOLLARS FOR PINEAPPLE, are you fucking kidding me??"</p><p>I managed to bob and weave around him as I filled my cart with ingredients for the evening's meal, indulging in plenty of fresh produce and herbs, a new bottle of olive oil. I like to buy nice foods and besides, I was having a bad week. Don't I deserve to treat myself?</p><p>I thought I'd lost him until I turned into the cheese aisle and found him having cornered a deli worker beside a stack of fancy Parmesan wheels, ranting about The Cost Of Things These Days.</p><p>"You can't even live!" I heard him exclaim. "Look at <em>her</em>! That's a month of my salary in her basket!"</p><p>The <em>her</em> he was referring to? Me, of course. I glanced over and there he was, pointing an angry finger in my direction, glowering at my basket piled high with shallots and dill.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, between the tip fiasco and this character, any positive relaxing effects of the massage were very swiftly departing.</p><p>I checked every item off my list except the keystone ingredient of my dinner recipe: dried chick peas. I was planning to make <a target="_blank" href="http://cookieandkate.com/2012/baked-falafel/">this falafel recipe</a> which says in no uncertain terms that one should NOT use canned chickpeas. Dried or GTFO. This fancy-ass grocery story had dried kidney beans and dried peas but nary a dried chick pea in sight.&nbsp;</p><p>I was frustrated, to be sure, but not defeated. I live in New York City, after all! I had two more grocery shopping options within a two block radius: the medium-sized, medium-priced Food Train, and the tiny but well-stocked Asian grocery memorably named The Bad Wife. I decided Food Train was my best bean bet, so I loaded my heavy canvas bags (reduce, reuse, recycle!) onto my rapidly re-tightening shoulders and trudged on over. Again: a wide variety of dried beans but NO CHICKPEAS.</p><p>A Garbanzo Goldilocks, I huffed out of the store, took a deep breath, and headed for The Bad Wife. This time, things would be <em>just right</em>.</p><p>I wove my way through the narrow aisles and there in front of me, my bounty lay: dried chick peas! &nbsp;They were a fancy organic brand, rather than the basic Goya I'm familiar with, but who doesn't love organic? GMO free, baby! I grabbed the bag, turned it over, and stopped in my tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>"SIX NINETY-NINE," I barked aloud, "for some dried beans?! Are you fucking kidding me??"&nbsp;</p><p>Sweet mother of pearl, there was a new unhinged grocery shopper in town ... and it was me.&nbsp;</p><p>I flung the beans back on the shelf and sprinted for the comfort of my home, locking the doors behind me and throwing myself on the couch with a dramatic sigh.</p><p>"Welcome home, babe!" called Brian from the other room. "How was your relaxing day?"</p><p>Great, great, SO GREAT.</p><p>And here we are. I think I'm in the home stretch on the work stuff but life loves to throw curve balls so if anyone could recommend some tried and true de-stressing activities that do not involve the following, would you please let me know?</p><p>Touching people, being touched, an option to leave a tip, needles, the use of one's knees, drugs, interacting with other human beings in any form, or dried chick peas.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a breezy person inside me, yearning to break free!&nbsp;</p><p>XO</p><p>Liz Hott</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Oops? I'd love to say I've been off somewhere exotic, but in reality I've been drowning in work, dealing with a frustrating knee injury (long story!), jetting off to Chicago for my brother's wedding, subsequently recovering for 2-6 weeks post my brother's wedding (how long do hangovers usually last? Asking for a friend!), etc. Normal things!&nbsp;I feel like I have one million ideas to write about, my brain is constantly tumbling over thoughts, but whenever I get a spare moment to sit at my computer, they fly away.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll capture them someday. Until then you can sit with growing anticipation for what brilliance I shall deliver.</p><p>Ok fine, I won't leave you totally hanging. Amid the working and the physical therapy and the peeing in an alleyway in downtown Chicago in a bridesmaid dress (oh like you've never peed in a city alley before), I have managed to find some time to sneak in a book or two. Or four, if I'm being entirely upfront here.&nbsp;</p><p>So, without further ado: here are the four books I read in March of 2017.

So just in case "must read" isn't powerful enough for ya, I took to the interwebs to come up with a few synonyms c/o thesaurus.com: obligatory, compulsory, binding, required, requisite, necessary, essential, imperative.&nbsp;</p><p>JUST MERCY is all of those things and a page turner to boot!&nbsp;</p><p>Bryan Stevenson is legit an American hero. After working with death row inmates in law school, Stevenson co-founded the <a href="http://eji.org/">Equal Justice Initiative</a>, fully dedicating his life's work to defending and fighting for wrongfully incarcerated, especially those sent to death row and young children convicted to gruesome life sentences. The narrative arc of the story is one of his first, and most famous cases, representing Walter McMillian, a man sent to death row for a crime he didn't commit. Interwoven with the McMillan case are absolutely harrowing statistics and stories about other clients of the EJI, about kids as young as 12 sentenced to life in solitary confinement for minor infractions, about men wrongfully sent to death row, about people usually too poor, too powerless, and yes, too black, to fight the system that's supposed to protect them. This book is timely and timeless at once and feels especially vital in light of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/31/521967661/arkansas-readies-for-8-executions-despite-outcry-over-pace-method">rush of executions</a> set to roll out in the next few weeks in Arkansas.&nbsp;</p><p>The stories he tells are crushing, and yet it's not all bleak, as Stevenson and the people who work with him and in support of him in the EJI are some of the most inspiring, moving, compassionate souls. It's horrific to think of the way that this country treats criminals and continues to perpetuate a mindset of white superiority and yet, knowing that there are people like Bryan Stevenson out there gives me a glimmer of hope. I know several friends - one a badass lady judge from my hometown, another an eager young law student - who consider him a hero and it excites me to think of other brilliant legal minds following in his footsteps moves me to the core.</p><p>And just a final note here, in case I haven't heard sold this enough, we all know nearly every book makes me cry at one point or another, &nbsp;but this one made me cry literally every time I opened it so we're talking about a real winner here.&nbsp;</p><p>Recommended For: Uh, everyone. What part of "obligatory, compulsory, binding, required, requisite, necessary, esssential, imperative" is unclear?&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1492992731533_43429"><div class="sqs-block-content">

So much. Technically a Young Adult novel,<em> The Hate U Give</em> (title pulled from a Tupac song) is the story of 16-year-old Starr who lives in a predominantly black inner-city neighborhood and goes to school at a preppy, predominantly white private school in the 'burbs, making her an expert in the art of code switching. One night she's the only witness as her childhood best friend is killed at the hands of a white police officer and she has to make serious choices and confront harsh realities that threaten to shatter the delicate balance she's created in her worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't usually like YA books because I'm an old curmudgeon but every now and again one comes along that I truly think transcends age genres. Starr and her friends and family are - for the most part - fully realized and complex and Thomas does an exceptional job at portraying a teen world that is nuanced and full. For Starr, and most teens in real life, I think (IDK it's been a while since I was a youth), boys and friends and math tests take equal billing in her mind alongside race relations and family strain and money concerns. That said, though the teen themes are universal, Angie Thomas does not whitewash (literally or figuratively!) her heroine, exploring fears and hopes unique to the experience of young Black women, who rarely get to be the stars of blockbuster films or bestselling novels. More of this, entertainment and publishing execs!&nbsp;</p><p>Also it's just a good read. Starr is hilarious, the dialogue is flawless, the plot is propulsive, the pop-culture references are spot-on, there's just enough teen romance to make you swoon, but not so much you have to roll your old lady eyes (you're 16, &nbsp;you're going to break up, get over it!), there's family drama, prom, cliquey girl groups, the works.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, this book did not make me cry on the subway but DID make me cry on an Amtrak train which is maybe even more powerful? Amtraks are so fancy, who could cry on such a luxurious chariot?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended for:</strong> Adult YA fans, parents and/or teachers of teens - I think this would be SUCH a good book to read alongside your t(w)een to help guide a discussion on race and activism, sneakerheads.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1492992731533_46631"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Of course you do, how could you forget! Well, my night didn't end when I slunk out the door of the fancy party and by slunk I mean tried to open the door myself, was startled when instead it was opened by a butler standing on the patio outside and suuuuper cooly remarked to him "Oh wow, I usually open my own doors, this is the fanciest place I've ever been."</p><p>VERY.</p><p>SMOOTH.</p><p>MOVES.</p><p>LIZ.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyhoodle I had initially thought the party was much later than it actually was, and Brian had made plans to host a poker night at our house, so I told him I'd make myself scarce so they could really bro out. I'd made plans to have dinner with a friend after the party, but she got held up at work so I figured if I could take myself to a cocktail mingle, I could certainly take myself out for a bite and a drink.</p><p>Also, like, how could the night get any worse?</p><p>By the grace of all that is holy, the remainder of the evening was a pure delight and I did not make any more scenes. Miracles happen! Instead, I cozied up at the bar at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.junebk.com/">June</a>, a chic little place in Cobble Hill, and ordered a glass of wine and a fancy Brussels sprout dish featuring "Parmesan whip" which turned out to be like, a cloud of Parmesan cheese and butter of some kind? I don't know, but it was magical and delicious, my mouth is watering thinking about it again. And the crown jewel atop this lovely dinner was my companion, Jami Attenberg's charming yet maddening new novel.&nbsp;</p><p><em>All Grown Up </em>is structurally interesting, reading almost like a linked connection of short stories rather than a full novel, all building together to tell the life of a rather ordinary woman, Andrea, and through her story, explore family, addiction, sex, romance, ambition, art, the changing landscape of Brooklyn neighborhoods, friendship. It's slim, easy to read, and I found it wholly affecting.</p><p>My friend Angie is very smart and cool and runs a fantastic podcast called the <a target="_blank" href="http://thelitupshow.com/">Lit Up Show,</a> which I also cannot recommend enough. She had Jami on the show a few months back and wrote what I thought to be the most accurate and selling description of what make this book resonant:&nbsp;"If you've ever been single, infatuated, partnered up, in a weird, not-right relationship (this excludes no one)... if you love your mom so hard and in the same moment think she might be killing you with her emotions, this fantastic novel is for you."</p><p>Yes! This book also reminded me a great deal of one of my all-time favorites, <em>The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing </em>by Melissa Banks. So a real winner here, folks.&nbsp;</p><p>And did I cry in public? 3 for 3 baby.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended for: </strong>um, what Angie said!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1492992731533_50880"><div class="sqs-block-content">

It's so fun how we're like this classic odd couple, you know? One of us is glamorous and brilliant and the other hasn't washed her hair in four days. And you can barely even tell from this picture which is which!&nbsp;</p><p>This book is a reprint of a letter she wrote to a friend, at the birth of her first child,&nbsp;after being asked for advice on raising feminists. Adichie admits she's not an expert on feminism <em>or</em>&nbsp;parenting, but still overs 15 ideas: teach them that gender roles are irrelevant, encourage them to read, teach girls not to worry so much about likeability. Her ideas aren't flawless, I'm sure, but I think she's starting interesting conversations about gender and feminism and as I look ahead to raising children of my own (like, <em>far</em> ahead, as previously stated, I just drank 5078 beers at my brother's wedding, don't get any fun ideas,&nbsp;close-readers in the crowd) &nbsp;I am a sponge for ideas on presenting teaching feminism to kids of both genders. I'm grateful to have this book in my life!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended for: </strong>parents of young children (would make an aces baby shower gift!); Chimamanda superfans; a passive-aggressive gift for a friend who thinks feminism doesn't apply to her life.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>And that'll be that! I have to admit in advance that there will be no Nonfiction Challenge Hott Read for April because someoneeee who shall not be named can't find her copy of <em><span style="display:none">&nbsp;</span>The New Jim Crow <span style="display:none">&nbsp;</span></em>and also decided that amid her busy schedule she needed to give herself a slight break on the heavy reading and just pick up a fun book or to and she's<em> of course</em> feeling guilty about failing the challenge but also, deep down, knows she made up the challenge and nobody cares so it's all fine, but she will continue to feel guilty nonetheless, because that is who she is.</p><p>She's fun.</p><p>Ok the end, have a GREAT final week of April and I promise to be back with more enthralling content lickity split. Or not. Who ever knows what I'll do!</p><p>Smooch,</p><p>Liz Ho&nbsp;</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I thought so.&nbsp;</p><p>Ok, back to February we go!&nbsp;First thing's first, this book is very, very, very long.&nbsp;I'm not saying this to discourage you from reading - oh no - but rather giving you a warning up front to allow yourself some time to tackle it, perhaps alongside a reading group with whom you can discuss all you're learning.&nbsp;Don't be like me, basically, foolishly assigning yourself to read the longest book in the shortest month and then panicking when it takes you longer than you thought to finish because you told the internet you'd read it in February and god forbid you let down the internet!!! Don't worry,&nbsp;I saved myself from the brink of meltdown when I remembered this is a one woman book club and literally no one cares. &nbsp;And, luckily for my pride and the consistency of this book-a-month thing, I managed to finish this baby the night of February 28th, with not a moment to spare.&nbsp;</p><p>Phew.</p><p>Ok wow I'm really doing a great job of selling this book, huh?&nbsp;</p><p>THE WARMTH OF OTHER SUNS tells the epic but largely untold story of The Great Migration, the mass exodus of Black Americans from the south to the North, Midwest, and West in the first half of the 20th Century. It was a movement with no defined beginning and no real leader which would completely change the American demographic fabric. Until 1910, more than 90%&nbsp;of Black Americans lived in the South, and most of them in rural areas, and by the 1970's, just under 50% of Black Americans lived in the North, West, and Northwest, with the majority in all regions living in urban areas. This mass migration of Black Americans led to the cities we recognize today - and read about last month in<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/2/1/hottreads"><em> Evicted </em></a>- ushering in the era of white flight, urban segregation, and broad racially based injustice in housing, education, and employment.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilkerson follows the stories of three everyday Americans: Ida Mae Gladney, a sharecropper's wife who moves from Mississippi to Chicago with her young family; Robert Pershing Foster, a brilliant doctor with big ideas and an ego to match who chases his dreams to Los Angeles; and George Starling, whose rabble-rousing and attempts at unionizing under violent Jim Crow rule in central Florida send him fleeing to New York City for better opportunities, and to not get his ass locked up or much, much worse. &nbsp;She weaves the life stories of these three, from childhood until very old age, exploring their lives in the South, their motivations for moving, and the lives they built in their new homes. Interspersed with their stories she tells the broader tale of the Great Migration, full of facts, figures, and anecdotes. The main story lines help to give a propulsive, central plot, but this is not a book you can just race through, every page is dense with information.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll admit, I did find this a challenge for me, this isn't a book you can flip through easily on the subway, while trying to balance a coffee and hold onto the pole at the same time. But, again, again, I feel I'm not being a very compelling book reviewer here - I'm just keeping it real about my own shortcomings. I'm very glad I read this book and, if anything, think I did myself a bit of a disservice by trying to cram it into a challenge rather than take my time and absorb the information. I would highly recommend everyone read this and do suggest, as I said up top, bringing in a group to dive into discussion. And invite me? I HAVE A MILLION THOUGHTS.&nbsp;</p><p>Two main takeaways that have lingered with me in the &nbsp;few weeks since I've read:&nbsp;</p><p>1) Why didn't I know about like,&nbsp;<em>any of this?</em>&nbsp;Granted, it's been a minute since I sat in a high school or college US History class but I don't recall The Great Migration ever being taught. We spent weeks on things like the Gold Rush and the Oregon Trail - white people boldly going where no white people have gone before! - but The Great Migration would have been a footnote, at best, though it did as much to shape the country we live in today.&nbsp;And it's got me thinking about the lens through which history (and let's be real, <em>everything)</em>&nbsp;is taught, and that lens is <em>for sure </em>white, and probably also straight, male, and Christian. Black History - along with Women's History, LGBT+ History, Native History, etc - is always kind of taught as a sidebar, like, here's <em>Real America, </em>kids,&nbsp;and then over here are some other stories. If you're only ever reading books by and about white men, except for a special Black History Month dip into the works of Langston Hughes, or a permission-slip needed, one-day-only lesson on the Stonewall Riots, it is hard, even for the most well-intentioned PBS watchers among us (ahem!) not to subconsciously absorb the narrative of certain people being inherently <em>other</em>.</p><p>And by other, I mean <em>lesser</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>And again, it's been a while since I was in school and I don't know jack about teaching or textbooks but I feel like there's gotta be a better way. Maybe some teachers in the crowd with insights? I'd (TRULY!!) love to discuss and learn more.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Speaking of <em>other people's history</em><em>, </em>goddamn if Americans ever learn from the past. This book is, of course, chockablock full of anecdotes of immigration and migration, of folks refusing to accept newcomers to their cities, even when recently newcomers themselves. This rejection is especially aimed at those who don't look quite like them, and always, ALWAYS, entirely out of self-interest and fear.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/07/12/donald_trump_in_phoenix_mexicans_are_taking_our_jobs_and_killing_us.html">Sound familiar</a>??</p><p>There was one story that really crystallized things for me, a brief interlude into the 1800's to touch on the Civil War Draft Riots in NYC in 1863, when a war draft led to five days of violence by Irish immigrants against Blacks living in their city. Wilkerson writes: "Anger rose among Irish working-class men, in particular, who couldn't afford to buy their way out of a war they felt they had not stake in. &nbsp;They saw it as risking their lives to defend southern slaves, <strong>who would, in their minds, come north and only become competition for them."&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Wait, when was that again? 200 years ago? Or last week?</p><p>In the past few months, as we talk about refugee crises and border walls, and America turns in on herself, as we debate which lives matter, and how much, I often hear people, usually of the privileged idealist liberal bent, righteously arguing that Trumpian white nationalism doesn't represent "true American values." Unforrrrrrtchhhhhh it kinda does. Those certainly aren't <em>my </em>values, and they may not be yours, but America, for all of her great melting pot rhetoric, does not have the most flawless track record for inclusion. In fact, if there is one trend we see repeating itself over, and over, and over again it is the vilifying and suppression of those we view as other.&nbsp;</p><p>How quickly we forget. How easy it is to lean into our fear.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be nice to think that we've come a long way since 1863, when these scared Irishmen rioted, or 1953, when Robert Pershing Foster arrived in LA and wasn't allowed to practice medicine on white people buuuutttt...have we? IDK, dudes. IDK.&nbsp;</p><p>ANYWAY clearly this book has resonated with me in a major way and I'd encourage you to give it a read, too. I know I made it sound pretty dense and intense and it definitely is both of those things, but it's also incredibly readable and compelling and even moving. I fell so in love with the three people she profiles, and this is going to sound corny, but felt like, honored to get to hear their stories. At the end of the day, these were just straight up regular people - they weren't celebrities or headliners, they were unremarkable, but sharing their stories was a remarkable act. Another key trait of history lessons is that we tend to focus on only the big players, the game changers. And those people are important, obviously, but there's so much to be learned from the lives of everyday people, too. And I'm so grateful for the opportunity to learn from Isabel Wilkerson and from these three remarkably unremarkable stories.&nbsp;</p><p>THE END! Two thumbs way up, would recommend. Have you read it? What did you think?&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/2/6/hottreads-2017-nonfiction-reading-challenge">2017 Reading Challenge here </a>&amp; up next: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780812984965">JUST MERCY by Bryan Stevenson</a>.

Those are, apparently, the goals of the man now holding the nuclear codes and wow I'm sure glad he's in charge here. As for me, it's a little more like this: don't go insane, access even a small pinch of understanding for "good people" who still voted for The Donald, and become a better citizen.&nbsp;</p><p>And how am I doing? No bueno, no bueno, and... getting there???</p><p>I'm still tiptoeing into the bigger political arena.&nbsp;I've been calling my senators (but real talk: not every single day...it's still so daunting and time consuming, excuses, excuses), signing petitions, and I even attended a progressive activism panel hosted by a local district council member! Look at me go!</p><p>Just kidding, so, so much room for growth.</p><p>But outside of the immediate Trumpian Resistance, my main area of focus on this good citizenry journey has been to become more engaged with my community and use my time and talents to serve and support my neighbors.</p><p>As for how <em>that's</em>&nbsp;going, well, if we consider being wildly socially awkward my main talent then it is going just SO GREAT!!</p><p>An anecdote:</p><p>In the past few months I have found myself moved by the work of a group called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.camba.org/">CAMBA </a>which has a truly inspiring comprehensive approach to bolstering strong communities here in Brooklyn. They recognize the interconnected nature of issues facing those most in need and their services are holistic: housing, education, addiction counselling, refugee services, job training and more all under one umbrella. They also offer eviction counselling, which you know is my new jam thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/2/1/hottreads">January's HottRead,</a> so I've been looking to become more involved with them on the ground level.&nbsp;</p><p>I actually first discovered CAMBA through my work, who occasionally partners with them on some corporate responsibility programs. Last year we raised funds for CAMBA through a company-wide walk, and earlier this winter there was an opportunity to go to a CAMBA location for a corporate day of volunteering which I did not, and I can not stress this enough, DID NOT ATTEND.&nbsp;</p><p><em>~Foreshadowing! ~&nbsp;</em></p><p>Somehow or other I ended up on their mailing list and snagged myself an invite to to a swanky informational cocktail reception. After doing several double-takes, checking that the e-vite was, in fact, addressed to me and not some wealthy, cocktail party-attending fancyperson, I enthusiastically clicked "yes!"</p><p>A friend was planing to join, but had to bow out to take care of her daughter, which is just like, <em>so unfair.</em>&nbsp;I mean, this kid is almost two I'm pretty sure she can fend for herself for a few hours, but meanwhile I really should not be left to my own devices in public.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided to still attend solo, because I am an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/2/26/vixqjijz5nle4tzz6f09oj1dh099fk">adult now</a>, and spent the entire day panicking about how to act normal, even dedicating my full hour of therapy for the week to mature mingling strategies. One of my main sources of anxiety (for the event, duh, there's not enough room on this or any other blog to list allll of my sources of anxiety) was the guilt and shame I have for not being a regularly active community citizen, and I imagined every person in the room listing all of the charity work they do, all the boards they serve on, all the good they've achieved, while I just chugged wine in a corner. We discussed that, when asked about my relationship to CAMBA and presence at the party, it would be best to avoid launching into the full answer of "well, I heard about them through work and then Donald Trump happened and I used to be such a good person and now I never help anyone except myself and I'm constantly abusing my privilege and the guilt is eating me alive and I actually have no idea why or how I ended up at this party I'm such a mess!!!", and instead just keep it simple: "I've been drawn to CAMBA's mission and am excited to hear more."</p><p>The evening of the party arrived and, to my surprise, I was feeling generally pretty confident. 'Twas one of those freakishly warm winter days, so I didn't have to worry about a giant coat and was able to wear my favorite big-girl outfit, this really chic navy blue wrap dress that evokes Kate Middleton's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/08/kate-middleton-engagement-dress">engagement look </a>(you know...minus the title, the flowing locks, perfect face, giant sapphire, etc), and the gods had blessed me with a lifetime top ten, maybe even top five hair day so I was pretty much bringing it, on the outside at least. I tried to channel my outer hotness into inner poise as I entered the party venue, a stately brownstone in one of Brooklyn's most chi-chi neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p><p>Things started fine.</p><p>I gave my name at the door and was given a little name tag. No issues!</p><p>I hung up my coat and purse on the designated coat rack, relieving me of the "wtf will I do with this giant tote bag worries." A win, tbh!&nbsp;</p><p>I fluffed my hair, straightened my dress, took a deeeep breath and entered the main room, whereupon I was immediately greeted by two very friendly CAMBA staffers, one of whom struck up a polite introductory conversation:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Her:</strong> "Hello!"</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> "Hello!"</p><p><strong>Her: </strong>"So how are you affiliated with CAMBA?"</p><p><strong>Me, confidently:</strong> "I've been drawn to CAMBA's mission and am excited to hear more..."</p><p><strong>END SCENE, </strong>flawless execution, you did it Liz, you're a champ. JUST KIDDING, there's more...</p><p><strong>Me, rambling:</strong>&nbsp;"...my company did a walk to raise funds and also did a day of corporate volunteering...which I attended."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Her, delighted: </strong>"Oh that's wonderful! I remember that day, which branch did you attend?"</p><p><strong>Me, flailing: </strong>"Um....the one in Flatbush...?" (a neighborhood in Brooklyn)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Her, confused:</strong> "Hmm, we don't have a branch in Flatbush, do you mean Kensington?"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Me, dying inside:</strong> "Oh {manic laughter} yes, obviously, I always get those two neighborhoods confused but yes, Kensington, of course, is the branch at which I volunteered."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Her, seeming skeptical: </strong>"Oh, I was the event leader at that branch that day, I don't remember meeting you..."</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> {<em>runs to window, throws self out</em>}</p><p>WHAT in the everliving fuck is wrong with me??? WHYYY did I just lie to this woman's face? I was so confident! I had that dress on, I had a plan...and I couldn't even make it <em>four minutes</em> without choking! No one even asked about volunteering. No one mentioned the corporate day of giving. There was literally no reason for that to have even been a topic of discussion until I started to word vomit, incriminating no one but myself. My greatest fear was that I would be outed as a fraud and instead I just doubled down and frauded all over the room.</p><p>Ugh. Ugh. UGHHH.</p><p>Blessedly, Her Heavenly Mother Queen Beyonce sent down a miracle at the moment I most needed it in the form of another group of party guests who arrived right in the nick of time, interrupting our conversation before I dug myself even further into a hole. I stayed on at the party for another hour or so, mainly because now I felt like I had to re-prove my normalcy, I didn't want them to be at the office the next day like "did you see that chick who came, lied to us, and then ran out the door?" Instead they could say "did you see that chick who came, lied to us, and then still hung around and ate all of our cheese?"&nbsp;</p><p>Win!&nbsp;</p><p>Sooooo yes, Operation Become A Good Citizen is off to a spectacular start, A++, I'm basically going to have my face on a postage stamp by 2019 at the rate I'm going.</p><p>In related news, does anyone know of any caves deep in the middle of the forest with a flexible lease until the end of time? Asking for a friend!&nbsp;</p><p>(The friend is me.)&nbsp;</p><p>xoxo Liz Hott&nbsp;</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I have some big news to share. I have become a woman!</p><p>No, I didn’t just start my period - that happened when I was in fourth grade, years before all the other girls, and I still have the emotional scars to prove it. Nor did I just lose my virginity - <em>that </em>happened well into my twenties, years <em>after</em> all the other girls, and I <em>did</em> have the emotional scars to prove it until I learned that Tina Fey also kept her v card until a late age so now I’m an out and proud member of the Old Virgins Club.</p><p>It turns out that, contrary to every Judy Blume novel ever written, womanhood is not one (likely v bloody) milestone that you can check off in your diary, but something unexpected and innate that sneaks up on you from behind whether you’re ready or not.</p><p>In every way I am an adult. I am thirty-two years old, by which I mean I’m very much “in my thirties,” woof. I’m married. I have a robust 401K and an assistant and a bad hip and multiple blazers and yet I still feel like a perpetual tween. I do in some ways think that city living may be a bit to blame. Unlike the town where I grew up, people here generally marry later, have kids later, live in tiny rental apartments with roommates into their 30’s, 40’s and beyond. The traditional trappings of adulthood, as embodied by the suburban parents of my childhood, don’t seem to apply to me or to any of my NYC friends, so I’ve been able to hold onto a sort of eternal Peter Pan feeling. We’re all growing older, but are any of us growing up? When I see my peers doing these adulty things like procreating or buying four bedroom houses on cul-de-sacs it feels utterly foreign and somehow wrong, like they’re play acting at real life. Those things are for adults and we can’t possibly be adults yet. &nbsp;I mean, I certainly am not! Or... am I?</p><p>Some of this, surely, is because I’m such a horrid snob about non-urban living - the word “cul-de-sac” is basically <em>moist</em> to my ears (shudder, shudder) - but in other ways it still just takes me by surprise every day that I’m allowed to do things like take money out of the bank or rent a car without a note from my mom.</p><p>I’d say it’s a mix of this snobbishness, a little jealousy, a whole bunch of fear, and no small pinch of denial that’s had me feeling pretty OK about this eternal tween scene. Who even needs adulthood?? SEEMS BORING.</p><p>And then, when I least expected it, it found me.</p><p>Last week I was hanging out with two young co-workers, both 22, fresh outta college,&nbsp;just like me! Err...me circa a literal decade ago. I have always known I’m like, older than these gals, but we’re all still peers, right? Hashtag millennials! Snapchat! The Chainsmokers, probably!?!?</p><p>The two of them were regaling the group with funny stories about their apartment situations - all the post-college classics like bad roommates and plenty of mice, navigating subleases and guarantors, pulling together just enough cash for a security deposit, crashing on couches, full of optimism and enviable naivete As they talked I became filled with these unexpected <em>feelings</em>. I was worried for them. I wanted to nurture them. I could sympathize with what they were going through, having been there myself before, but I could not currently relate.&nbsp;Instead of being like, “OMG girls, life is so crazy, should we do some shots?!”, I just...nodded, a supportive yet moderately concerned look on my face. I gave them advice on dealing with landlords and reminded them never to meet a person from Craigslist without a buddy. I blithely uttered the phrase, “when I was your age,” with no irony whatsoever and all at once it hit me: holy shit, me, you are a grown-up.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently to achieve adulthood you need not purchase a townhouse or a minivan or even just one of those medium sized SUVs all the hot soccer moms are driving these days, you simply need to close your eyes and think “dear god, you could not pay me to be 22 again” and whoosh, there you are, in adulthood. It’s like Dorothy clicking her ruby slippers to get home again except instead of leaving Oz behind, it’s your youth that’s fading from technicolor behind you.</p><p>Ain't life something?&nbsp;</p><p>So there you have it, world, I am an adult now. I am not a girl, not yet ... nope...<strong><em> 100% </em></strong>a woman. And I don’t know how I feel about it, so if anyone’s looking for me you’ll find me at the nearest Chico’s indulging in a little retail therapy while I sort it all out.</p><p><br />Whatever the mature version of xoxoxox is,&nbsp;</p><p>HoBag&nbsp;</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Um, me either, I worked very hard all day!!</p><p>But just in case you do need a bit of a brain break, here is a quick story for your Monday night.</p><p>Anyone who spends time with me IRL quickly becomes aware that they are a lucky bitch because I am amazing.&nbsp;</p><p>Ha, just kidding, that's not what I was going to saaay.</p><p>Anyone who spends time with me IRL quickly becomes aware that I am <em>obsessed </em>with hydration, to a level bordering on unhinged.&nbsp;I have three glasses of water before I leave the house and usually 8-10 more 16oz bottles by EOD. Every time I pee I check out the scene to monitor the situation and if my urine is not crystal clear by noon I get stressed and slam a few cups of H20 to speed up the process. Once, a year or two ago, I had a UTI, because being a human woman is an EVIL TRAP, and I went to the clinic and peed in the lil cup and the doctor came back and pulled up the test results on the computer and said "I can tell by looking at your results that you are very hydrated," and I blushed and beamed and replied "thank you so much for noticing!" As if she was commenting on my liquid eyeliner application or clean baseboards.&nbsp;</p><p>When I said "bordering on unhinged" I may have meant like, very far beyond unhinged...&nbsp;</p><p>So it should be an obvious no duh by this point that I literally never leave the house without a water bottle. Ever. This means I always have to lug some kind of big bag with me, even if I'm going to like, a club (lol as if) or trendy restaurant (slightly more likely). I would so rather risk a fashion <em>don't</em>&nbsp;than be caught out there dehydrated whilst daintily holding my evening clutch.</p><p>A true nightmare scenario.</p><p>Why am I telling you all of this TMI about my inner neurosis / urine color? Stay with me. This is alllll helpful background information to have in mind as we *finally* find ourselves at the beginning of my tale.</p><p>'Twas a week ago today, around eleven in the AM and I was returning to my office from a doctor's appointment.

IDK guys), &nbsp;along with some assorted nonsense which shall be discussed later.&nbsp;</p><p>I swiped my card through the turnstile, moseyed (obviously sprinted) to a suitable spot on the platform and stood patiently waiting for my train. I was a little thirsty from all the moseying (sprinting), not to mention that I consider any amount of downtime to be a primo opportunity to re-up on the hydraysh, so I reached into my purse and pulled out my water bottle only to discover it was now...empty.&nbsp;</p><p>I plunged my hand back into my purse and like a kid digging a hole to China via the Jersey Shore, I hit water. I must not have screwed on the lit tightly last time I took a public chug! In a panic I began to pull out my important belongings. My wallet...soaked. My book...soaked. My #bujo...miraculously only a tiny bit damp, praise be to you Beyonce, who so should have won Best Album, everyone knows Lemonade was the greatest album of the year / decade, even people who forgot to watch the Grammys!&nbsp;</p><p>And then, my train came.</p><p>I had two options. Option one was to pull out all of my stuff, dump the water onto the tracks, cry about my misfortune, and cause a big ol' scene right there in the 23rd Street 1 Train Station. Or I could choose option two, which was to board the train, hold my sopping books in my arms, and ride the four stops back to my office with two inches of water sloshing around my handbag. And then, you know, pull out all my stuff, dump the water into the sink, cry about my misfortune...and cause a big ol' scene right there in the middle of my office.</p><p>I chose option two.</p><p>Y'all I boarded the train and I carried the water all the way home.</p><p>(That &nbsp;kind of sounds like a gospel song! <em>Carry the water, children. I carry the water, Oh Lord.)</em></p><p>(Pretty sure those are just the lyrics to Wade in the Water but with a lil remix.)</p><p>(Enough parenthetical asides, Liz.)</p><p>When I got back to the office I carried my water over to the communal kitchen sink, tipped the bag over, and out poured half a liter of water, as though from a lovely pitcher. I assessed the damage. In addition to the above mentioned book and journal, I pulled out 3 half-full travel sized packs of tissues (all obviously ruined), several handfuls of change (unscathed!), one running sock that had been in there since who even knows when (soaked but salvageable), miscellaneous receipts (destroyed),and the real kicker: two very important referral papers handed to me by the doctor I'd visited just before my ill-fated subway purse drowning situation. One of these papers contains notes from my doctor to a physical therapist who I am to see next Monday for the first time. I need to present this piece of paper to the physical therapist so she knows what my issues are.&nbsp;</p><p>My physical issues, that is. No one needs a paper note to see my mental issues, which will be fully apparent when I hand her a crumpled script that is ripped at one corner and bears the texture of an elementary school homemade paper making project gone awry, having once been soaked and then left to dry on the back of my desk chair. I should just call the original doctor and tell them I need a replacement prescription but I don't want them to think I'm irresponsible. For some reason that seems more embarrassing to me than waltzing into the physical therapists office with a ruined piece of garbage.</p><p>Where did I say I was on the unhinged scale again? Maybe we should double it.</p><p>Anyway, all's well that ends well, I suppose. My most beloved of possessions, the journal, snuck through generally unscathed with just a few bits of runny ink towards the top of some pages, and after a few days to dry out, my copy of <em>The Warmth of Other Suns </em>now looks rather chic. My assistant saw it sitting on my desk all yellowed, sans dustcover (a tragic casualty, RIP dustcover, I hope you had a great life), and exclaimed "wow, what a cool antique book!" I didn't have the heart to tell her it is not, in fact, an antique, but a relatively new book I ruined. She'll find out I'm a hot mess soon enough, but until that day I'll let her - and the world! - think I'm some kind of intellectual savant whose handbag is overflowing with antique literary works, instead of spilled water, wet socks, and garbage.</p><p>The joke is definitely on them!&nbsp;</p><p>And by them, I mean me.</p><p>Have a grand week, m'dears. Don't forget to hydrate, hydrate, HYDRATE and also always check your water bottle lids.&nbsp;</p><p>Peace, Love, and Clear Pee -</p><p>Liz Hott&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

You know when you're watching a phenomenal documentary and it's so good, you forget it's real life? I guess the simpler way to express this would be to say the book reads like a novel, but that feels like it negates the writing, somehow, so I spice it up.</p><p>Just get to the point, Liz!</p><p>To write <em>Evicted</em>, MacArthur Genius and Harvard sociologist Matthew Desmond embedded himself in two of Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods for two years, in 2008-09, at the peak of the financial crisis to study first-hand the rising eviction rates incurred by the renting poor. He divvied his time between the predominantly black, "inner-city" North Side and a predomimnantly white trailer park community on the city's South Side.&nbsp;</p><p>His story follows an array of tenants - a single mom, a former nurse consumed by a debilitating heroin addiction, a man with no legs trying to keep his two sons (and the rest of the neighborhood boys)&nbsp;out of trouble, a family of eight crammed into a tiny one bedroom apartment - and two landlords, Sharenna, a self-made inner-city entrepreneur and Tobin, who manages the mobile park. &nbsp;Though wildly diverse in their personal struggles, all of the tenants share the same debilitating poverty, hanging on by a thread.&nbsp;Across America, rents are arbitrarily decided upon by private landlords and are not priced proportionally to income, so the renting poor, many unemployed or at most, underemployed, are forced to pay 60-80% of their wages to rent, leaving very little for things like clothes, food, even basic utilities. Falling behind on rent can lead to eviction, pulling apart families, sending families into a cycle of homelessness and instability that is difficult to break.</p><p>Desmond argues that housing insecurity is the linchpin of this cycle. When a person does not have stable housing, everything else is affected - their ability to hold down a job, to send their kids to a good school, to feed themselves, to build self worth. Desmond does offer some ideas on how we might address this issue via housing vouchers, income-based rents, and other initiatives, but admits it is not an easy solve and he doesn't have all the answers. Instead, he hopes these stories will &nbsp;bring this issue out of the shadows and encourage everyone to make housing stability a national priority.</p><p>It feels funny to say that I enjoyed reading this book - can one really <em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;reading true stories of other people struggling so viscerally - and yet, I loved this book. Desmond's writing is brilliant, portraying these people with such nuance in all of their flawed, broken, striving, beautiful truth. Their stories lingered with me each time I closed the pages, it was one of those books I'd read while walking down the sidewalk, immediately upon walking in the door, late into the evening. I still can't get it out of my head. I've begun to study NYC rental and eviction regulations (it's all so over MY head, and I have a college education and endless free time, and access to the internet and other resources to get help, I can't even imagine how confusing it must be for people who don't have the same privileges I've been so luckily granted in life) and am going to begin volunteering with a local organization here in Brooklyn that helps with eviction prevention, alongside a number of other really outstanding initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>And this is only book one of (at least) twelve in my 2017 social justice nonfiction challenge! If I keep up at this rate, I'll be like, Mother Teresa by December. Again, it sounds kind of funny to say, but I am so excited to keep going in this challenge, I feel like I've already learned so much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended for:</strong> Everyone.&nbsp;I truly can't recommend this book strongly enough.</p><p>~~</p><p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> For bookkeeping purposes (like, literally and organizationally), I've started a landing page under the HottReads tab for the 2017 Reading Challenge<strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2017/2/6/hottreads-2017-nonfiction-reading-challenge"> here</a></strong>, where I'll be building my list and updating with reviews each month. I'd LOVE for you to join me in any / all of the books!&nbsp;</p><p>Next up: <em>The Warmth of Other Suns</em> by Isabel Wilkerson. I'd initially had <em>The New Jim Crow</em> planned for February, but decided I wanted to swap in this one, which looks at the great migration of Black Americans from the south to northern cities in the early to mid-20th century. I thought this would give an enlightening historical context to some of the other titles on my list - including <em>Evicted</em> and <em>New Jim Crow </em>- so figured I'd move it up on the list.&nbsp;</p><p>~~</p><p>Now movin' it and shakin' it to a few other favorite recent reads.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1486387300331_35647"><div class="sqs-block-content">

As we all know, I read basically every buzzy psychological thriller that enters the marketplace and though I usually enjoy the reading experience, when it comes to the thrills and chills, I'm often let down.&nbsp;Especially when the marketing materials (ugh, publishing people, am I right, folks?)&nbsp;promise a big twist. "You will be shocked!" blares a cover blurb. "A twist of epic proportions!"</p><p>I gotta say, I'm rarely shocked. I'm often kind of surprised, like "huh, I didn't suspect him to be the bad guy" or creeped out or maybe breathlessly racing to find out what's what, so I'm not saying I don't enjoy these other reads, because clearly I do,&nbsp;but it is a raaaare book that has me gasping in disbelief. I think the last one was probably<em> Gone Girl</em> and if my math is correct I've read close to 760 thrillers since then, give or take. Well Clare Mackintosh ya done gone and did it, girl. I was instantly pulled into to this story which follows several lives unraveled after a young boy is killed in a hit and run and true to the press materials, there was an actual twist so shocking I yelled "OH MY GOD!" and Brian came running from the other room to see what was the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't want to spoil anything so I'm going to zip it here, if you are a thriller fan, grab this one posthaste and email me the second you're done so we can talk about it - lizhottsauce@gmail.com. KEWL.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended for: </strong>Fans of twisty thrillers like <em>Gone Girl, Girl on the Train, Woman in Cabin 10</em>, thriller aficionados who swear they <em>can not </em>be tricked, anyone looking for a fun and absorbing read to devour over a weekend or travel.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1486387300331_41151"><div class="sqs-block-content">

What a fresh idea.&nbsp;I feel confident recommending both of these to you in the same post, as I feel equally enthusiastic and they're just different enough. <em>Where I Let You Go</em> is twisty and shocking, <em>Under the Harrow </em>is spare, tense, unnerving in its brilliant portrayal of a woman on the edge. &nbsp;</p><p>Nora travels from London to a small country town a few hours north, to visit her sister, Rachel, and instead finds her brutally murdered in her home. In shock, Nora is unable to return to her old life and finds herself haunting the small town Rachel lived in, slowly unraveling as she obsessively tries to solve the crime, all the while haunted herself by a violent crime that happened to Rachel years in the past. What she uncovers reveals she may not have known her sister as well as she thought - or that we might not know Nora as much as initially let on. As she falls deeper into the investigation, her motives become blurred, her sanity hazy. This again falls into that broad unreliable narrator genre but to me is one of the smartest and darkest I've read in a while. Nora's descent into obsession is chilling, I found myself at once fearing for her and just fearing her.&nbsp;</p><p>Bonus: this book is a slim one, at just 24 pages. The story is suspenseful enough to keep you moving no matter what, but amid piles of door stoppers it can be a real treat to read a book that tells just what it needs to and not a page more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommended for:</strong> fans of smart literary suspense who are as intrigued by the inner workings of the human psyche as they are about solving a whodunit, people with sisters or close best friends who <em>think</em>&nbsp;they know everything their is to know about that other person, readers with excellent nightlights because you will not be able to put this one down.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1486387300331_46564"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Facing the inevitable end of his young life, he began to write, telling a story that is as much a memoir of a brilliant medical life cut short, as it is a literary, lyrical meditation on mortality and morality. Paul lost his battle to cancer before finishing the book, so his widow Lucy wraps it up with a heartbreaking and intimate epilogue, reflecting on the life of her partner, and sharing the deep, raw grief she now experiences.</p><p>I had read a lot about this book when it came out last January, including <a target="_blank" href="https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/my-marriage-didnt-end-when-i-became-a-widow/">this stunning essay </a>by Lucy in the <em>New York Times</em>, but finding myself unable to read so much as a <em>review</em>&nbsp;without sobbing, I knew I needed to save to read until I was ready. Finally, cozied up over the holidays, I pulled from the shelf, grabbed my tissues, and dug in. And I'm so glad I did.&nbsp;</p><p>I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of medical writing or spiritual meditations. Neither of those genres are my usual jam, but perhaps they should be, this pushed me beyond my comfort zone, both in considering ideological concepts of mortality, belief, and ambition, and in grappling with the devastating reality that his story could happen to any of us. It was hard not to think of Brian when reading Lucy's reflections on Paul.</p><p><strong>Recommended for: </strong>uh, see above, anyone! Just be sure you have a hanky or twelve nearby.&nbsp;</p><p>And that'll be that, folks. What are you reading lately? Wishing you a beautiful week to come and happy reading!&nbsp;</p><p>xoxo Liz Hott&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

We traveled by MegaBus Friday evening, a trip that was to take 5-6 hours and came in closer to 8, finally dragging into Union Station close to midnight. The bus was stuffy and bumpy and as we stopped and started down the Jersey Turnpike, it became warmer and warmer until finally, unable to bear the heat, one woman approached the driver to inquire about adjusting the heat, which he revealed to be a crisp 83 degrees. Oof. But from this discomfort emerged a warm camaraderie which would set the tone for the rest of the weekend. Nearly all of the other passengers were also headed down to the march, everyone with homemade signs and comfortable sneakers. When we finally did arrive in DC and emerge, blinking, from our brick oven of a bus, we saw dozens of other buses unloading fellow protesters, everyone buzzing with energy. I realized our bus parked right next to a bus marked with the emblem of the Chickasaw Nation, which had likely traveled in from Oklahoma, and I was awestruck -for the first, but not even close to last - time at the scope of the event in which we were about to participate.</p><p>Early Saturday morning we hit the streets, bundled in layers of heattech and spirited layered &nbsp;t-shirts - Kathleen had a homemade shirt with the slogan "Women's Rights = Human Rights" across the chest, and I wore my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMjR_79B-5y/?taken-by=lizho914">Unapologetic</a> shirt, natch, the same shirt I wore to vote for Hillary Clinton <em>and </em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hottsauceblog.com/blog/2016/9/12/rb84f9wo6dsdk2ev5xojk3j4fi8kn2?rq=necklace">awkwardly interrogate </a>the manager of the jewelry-thieving boutique in my neighborhood. Two equally momentous moments in women's history!!! After obsessively reading up on rules for the march, I had purchased a hideous clear backpack &nbsp;the only regulation bag allowed by the NPS, and filled it up with water bottles, because if I am one thing, it's a rule follower and if I'm two things, it's a rule follower who is obsessed with hydration.&nbsp;</p><p>But not quite as much as this guy, who is my new role model:</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_4_1485397072529_17217"><div class="sqs-block-content">

In between, we wandered from street to street, trying to take everything in. The march was a bit disorganized, I must admit, likely accounting to the massive swell of visitors. The day began with a rally featuring incredible speakers like Angela Davis, Gloria Steinem, Cecile Richards, America Ferrara, and Michael Moore, and musical performances from Solange (omg), Katy Perry, and obvzzzz the Indigo Girls. Cell service came in and out throughout the day, but I managed to catch some just enough for my brother to text that Indigo Girls performing at a Women's Rally is the center square in Feminist Bingo.</p><p>El. Oh. El. Too true.</p><p>I am disappointed we didn't get to catch much of the rally,&nbsp;I really would have liked to see or hear more, but it was fun just to soak in the energy. As many people have remarked, the vibe was so, so, positive and <em>polite</em>. Everyone was elbow to elbow, constantly bumping into one another, and each time, the women would turn to each other and apologize. Kathleen, Mo, and I cracked up each time, referencing this classic Amy Schumer sketch, only to find ourselves blurting out "omg sorry!" the next time we turned around. People were sharing snacks, helping one another cross streets, high fiving cops, at one point a group was trying to cut through a large mass of people standing in the street...and they walked ON THE CROSSWALK! It was adorable. Anne Helen Petersen, one of my favorite writers, penned a really thoughtful piece about how the symbols of this particular march - homemade hats, signs, regulation backpacks - represented how inherently feminine this march was. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/the-signs-they-carried">Worth a read</a>!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_4_1485397072529_28251"><div class="sqs-block-content">

We'd been so ensconced in our little cluster of folks right around the National Mall that we thought we were <em>it</em>. But as we elbowed our way out of the crowd, we realized we were just one of many mini-marches streaming all over the city. As we headed out, groups were pouring into the main area, blasting music, chanting, dancing. For several blocks in all directions the streets were blocked off, bars and restaurants open to the street, women in pink hats as far as the eye could see. It was truly incredible to be part of.&nbsp;</p><p>And then we went back to our hotel and were rewarded by a beautiful cable TV lineup consisting of a Lindsay Lohan marathon (<em>Mean Girls</em> and <em>The Parent Trap</em>) followed by <em>Frozen</em>. There <em>is</em>&nbsp;a god and she is good!&nbsp;</p><p>But more on the march! Among the protesters, we met a group of young women from Hanover College in Indiana, Mike Pence's alma-mater, who traveled 12 hours by overnight bus, doing their homework on their laps, to protest against the ideologies of their now famous (or shall I say <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-radical-crusade-of-mike-pence-w462223"><em>infamous</em>)</a> vice presidential alum. We met women who'd traveled in from California, Georgia, Maine, Boston, Oregon. We chanted alongside the funniest young girl named Saja, who led the crowd in enthusiastic rounds of "not my president," hilariously throwing her whole body into the cheer.</p><p>The crowd was heavily skewed towards female, but a lot of men joined too. There were older women relying on walkers who still stood up and marched. Parents with babies strapped to their backs or in strollers. We marched next to a middle aged man in a wheelchair who wore a tshirt with "Donald eres una pendejo" emblazoned across the front. Feel free to Google Translate that ish!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_4_1485397072529_35958"><div class="sqs-block-content">

There really was an overwhelming sense of communal forward energy, of women (and men, but mostly women) who have been quiet for too long finally speaking up.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the other of the main criticisms (oh, and there have been many) (some likely valid, I'm sure!), lobbed at the march in the past few days has been on this theme:&nbsp;"W<em>here have you been before this?? Why are you just getting mad now??"&nbsp;</em>This question comes from two distinctly different groups. First, from people who generally seem annoyed by the march and consider protesters "crybabies," who I would politely ask to mediate on the cliche "the straw that broke the camel's back" and also email me (lizhottsauce@gmail.com) if they'd like to discuss in depth in a civil way.&nbsp;But the second group is one I want to really take to heart, and this comes from groups of women who <em>have</em>&nbsp;been fighting on the front lines of justice for women, primarily non-white, non-straight women who have had to wage daily battles for their rights which I just haven't had to go through. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/the-radical-possibility-of-the-womens-march">Here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theroot.com/woman-in-viral-photo-from-women-s-march-to-white-female-1791524613">here</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/magazine/who-didnt-go-to-the-womens-march-matters-more-than-who-did.html?_r=0">here</a> are a few pieces I've been meditating on, if you think this might be something for you to consider, too.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="row sqs-row"><div class="col sqs-col-6 span-6"><div class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_4_1485397072529_67221"><div class="sqs-block-content">

I have not been as active or as vocal as I could have been. There's that saying "put your money where your mouth is," but the problem is, I kind of need to put my mouth where my money is. I've happily given as much as I can financially to causes I believe in. But I have yet to march in a Black Lives Matter rally.&nbsp;I just voted in a mid-term election for the first time this past fall and mostly only so I could show off about it on Instagram. I do call my senator every time there was a mass shooting (so like, once a week), but I never really follow up, I just kind of check it off the list and move on. In high school and college I used to be so active in community engagement and then when I moved to New York I just kind of stopped. I'll do some outreach here and there but I've never made it a cornerstone of my life the way I used to and I'm ashamed of that.&nbsp;</p><p>I suppose I have Donald Trump - and Mike Pence, and Paul Ryan, and Betsy "Dolores Umbridge" Devos, and the whole motley, racist, misogynist, homophobic crew - to thank for ultimately being the straw that broke <em>my</em> back, for lighting the fire that's been simmering inside of me, untended, for all of these years. I'm fired the fuck up. And should I have been protesting years ago? PROBABLY. Could I have been better about being engaged with the community? FOR SHEEZY. But is it too late to get started now? Is it too late to make a change? is it too late to apologize? No, Justin Bieber,&nbsp;it's never too late. Don't tell me what I can't do!&nbsp;</p><p>And I'm saying this both because it's like, a rah-rah, inspiring end to this blog post, but also, mostly because of accountability. Studies show that if you tell a people you'll do something - go on a diet, quit smoking, whatever - you may be more likely to actually go through with it. And anecdotal data has shown that I,&nbsp;<em>personally</em>, am very motivated by a fear of letting people down or being considered a failure. And also by attention, ha. So I figured if I told all of the millions of people who read this blog (hey mom!) that I was going to try to become a better citizen, well, maybe I would.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see!&nbsp;</p><p>Now tell me - did you march? Where? How was it for you? How are YOU taking action and accountability in the coming days? I'm all ears for suggestions! Conversely, do you have totally different viewpoints that me and want to have a respectful discussion? I'm working hard to be a better listener, so I'd really love to hear from you.</p><p>Fired Up, Ready to Go -</p><p>Liz &nbsp;</p><p> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
