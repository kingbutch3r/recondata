While I’ve long considered <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2019/1/20/a-ha-hunting-high-and-low-album-review?rq=hunting%20"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Hunting High &amp; Low</em></span></a><em> </em>to represent some of the very best music in both the synth-pop and new wave eras, only four songs from that incredible debut made it to this 16-track compilation. Nevertheless, an artist’s legacy is a sum of all parts and <em>Headlines And Deadlines </em>showcase just how tight and polished a-ha were as a musical unit throughout their most formative years; but is this really the best of a-ha?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prior to examining the selected songs and declaring if this is a collection of songs worthy of a-ha’s greatest creative output, it’s important to note that the streaming editions of <em>Headlines And Deadlines</em> have a different track listing to the physical counterparts. No songs are omitted but they are rearranged meaning that those of you who may have been used to the CD release may find this tracking mildly irritating. It also makes no sense that these variants exist but even more confusing is the fact that the original compilation was billed as <em>The Hits of a-ha! </em>while the streaming editions have been relabelled as <em>The Best of a-ha </em>with the original artwork remaining intact; a trivial variance, yes, but an oddity nonetheless. Add to this the fact that the 2018 vinyl re-issue omits songs, it is fair to say that there isn’t a definitive edition of <em>Headlines And Deadlines</em>, thus sticking with the streaming edition seems like the most logical solution.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642999572576_57936"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="900" style="width:100%;max-width:1400px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/au/album/headlines-and-deadline-the-best-of-a-ha/747796629"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1643594653131_13334"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Cry Wolf </strong>offers a solid opening to the streaming compilation and is a song that I both love and loathe; yes, dear reader, that is possible! If I’m in the mood to groove and dance then there is nothing better, but if my mood is a little more sombre and serious Cry Wolf then becomes a challenging listen but ultimately fails to change my mood. It is a subjective challenge that I’ve never fully understood but one that I feel compelled to share for music, even that which we love, may not always appeal to us.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Stay On These Roads </strong>is a beautiful song and in some ways, I could see this as a better option for the opening of the streaming editions as it offers a slow burn. Morten Harket's vocal is simply stunning throughout, an instrument in its own right, making this arguably one of his greatest vocal achievements and ensuring that Stay On These Roads is one of my all-time favourite a-ha songs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Blood That Moves The Body </strong>has a <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/artist/grace-jones/32200"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Grace Jones</span></a> feel meaning I love it! Of course, it is 100% a-ha and despite a difficult to interpret lyric, it is most certainly worthy of inclusion here. A brilliant tune!&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Touchy! </strong>is a fun song with a catchy chorus. Sometimes that is all a song needs to be.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I’ve Been Losing You </strong>may have been a success but I honestly don’t know how it achieved such popularity for I feel it simply isn’t a good song, let alone being single or compilation worthy. Perhaps I’m out of touch with the zeitgeist that surrounded its release but it simply defies logic when reflecting on the music through a modern lens.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Manhattan Skyline </strong>is, arguably, as rock and roll as a-ha<em> </em>has ever been and is a masterful tune that fits perfectly into a-ha’s back catalogue of music. Despite being recorded and released in 1986 it doesn’t sound dated, unlike many other songs from the era.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Crying In The Rain </strong>is a musical masterstroke, from <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/east-of-the-sun-west-of-the-moon/378016648"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em></span></a><em>,</em> with imagery that will make sense to all of us if we care to reflect viscerally.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Early Morning </strong>has a compelling synth element throughout, but it’s largely unforgettable and never really achieved much acclaim as a single in its own right. Subsequently, I question its inclusion here.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Call Your Name</strong>, also from<em> East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em> is an enjoyable filler track but as with Early Morning, it fails to captivate the music-centric elements of my soul. Perfect B-side material and enjoyable to listen to, but it isn’t compilation worthy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Hunting High And Low (Remix) </strong>is, as I’ve said <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2019/1/20/a-ha-hunting-high-and-low-album-review?rq=hunting"><span style="text-decoration:underline">before</span></a>, absolutely stunning. I must admit that I wasn’t sold on the Remix, for I believe that compilations should have the original Album or Single version, rather than Medleys, Remixes, or Live performances, but this is one exceptional remix that proves there are exceptions to the rules.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>You Are The One (Remix) </strong>is closely aligned to the original album version and that’s a good thing for it’s a great upbeat tune. The remix in this instance boosts the energy of the song in such a way that I prefer it over the original album mix as heard on <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/stay-on-these-roads/300946993"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Stay On These Roads</em></span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Train Of Thought (Remix) </strong>has an addictive rhythm and while I’ve <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2019/1/20/a-ha-hunting-high-and-low-album-review?rq=hunting"><span style="text-decoration:underline">previously suggested</span></a> that it has an Elton John (think <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2018/6/22/elton-john-victim-of-love-album-review?rq=Elton%20John%20"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Victim Of Love</em></span></a>) and Grace Jones’ feel, this remix immediately makes me think of <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/?category=David+Bowie"><span style="text-decoration:underline">David Bowie</span></a>. Regardless of the influence, or originality, it’s one of the very best songs in a-ha’s back catalogue and another of the remixes that I feel improves the song when compared directly to the original mix.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Move To Memphis</strong>, much like Manhattan Skyline, has a soft rock edge that is thoroughly captivating with a Bowie-inspired sound. It may have been a new tune, but works well against the legacy songs featured on this compilation. Interestingly, Move To Memphis was re-recorded for the 1993 album <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/memorial-beach/62445123"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Memorial Beach</em></span></a> but is so close to this original that it almost isn’t worth mentioning, except that the re-recording has a little more of a pop-inspired sound which connects the song to their legacy sound signature. Think of it this way, the compilation release is akin to a radio edit while the re-recording is the album version.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Living Daylights (Single Version) </strong>is, of course, the theme song from the associated 007 James Bond flick, but it isn’t that good as a song on its own or as a theme song. Comparing the single release to the album version as featured on <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/the-living-daylights-2015-remastered/1044495108?i=1044495999"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Stay On These Roads</em></span></a>, the latter is much preferred as it is, arguably less James Bond focused meaning it can be better enjoyed as a song in its own right. Naturally, given the purpose of a compilation, it’s logical that the most familiar tune be released but if you get a chance, check out the album version as I’m certain you won’t regret it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Take On Me, </strong>as I’ve suggested before, isn’t my favourite a-ha tune; it’s simply too campy. Yes, that will likely disappoint those who consider it to be iconic of the new wave era, but the one element that really detracts me is Morten Harket’s high pitched vocal as it’s simply too much and can become headache-inducing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Sun Always Shines On T.V. </strong>is, <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2019/1/20/a-ha-hunting-high-and-low-album-review"><span style="text-decoration:underline">as I’ve suggested before</span></a>, a stadium filling tune if there ever was one and it makes for a perfect closing song that encourages playing <em>Headlines And Deadlines </em>again and again.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is little doubt that a-ha!<em> </em>represents some of the very best music from the synth-pop and new wave eras and <em>Headlines And Deadlines </em>is one compilation that grows on you the more you listen to it. In the modern era, it could be suggested that a self-curated playlist will always trump a pre-programmed compilation but despite other releases such as <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/the-singles-1984-2004-remastered/368555809"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>The Singles 1984-2004</em></span></a><em>, </em><a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/25-the-very-best-of-a-ha/383431353"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>25: The Very Best of</em></span></a><em>, and</em> <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/time-and-again-the-ultimate/1087628947"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Time and Again: The Ultimate</em></span></a>, along with an official <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/playlist/a-ha-essentials/pl.08eb9d068bd1413886c5831dd262d4bc"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Essentials</span></a> playlist, I still find <em>Headlines And Deadlines </em>to be a compelling offering that is the perfect length with the core hits from a-ha that you’ll want to listen to. Yes, there are a few songs that I don’t feel are necessarily worthy of such regard, but when listening to this compilation it is easy to forget that aspect and simply enjoy their collective works. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642999572576_58514"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/?category=A-Ha">Check out more a-ha reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642999572576_59287"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

For this album, however, David Briggs played the producer’s role and assisted in creating an album that was still focused on psychedelic influences but was less avant-garde than Alice Cooper’s self-produced 1969 debut <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/alice-cooper-pretties-for-you-album-review"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Pretties for You</em></span></a><em>. </em>Part of the shift was undoubtedly due to Briggs’ influence, who by that stage was already well established with Neil Young having co-produced <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/neil-young-remastered/317517481"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Neil Young</em></span></a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/everybody-knows-this-is-nowhere/1015769589"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</em></span></a><em>, </em>but it’s also fair to say that Briggs didn’t connect with the band in the same manner as Ezrin would when recording <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/love-it-to-death/40458532"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Love It to Death</em></span></a>. According to Alice Cooper drummer Neal Smith, Briggs had called Alice Cooper’s music ‘psychedelic shit’<a href="https://bravewords.com/features/original-alice-cooper-drummer-neal-smith-a-halloween-treat">¹</a>. It was in relation to the song Lay Down and Die, Goodbye, so context is important, for the song is psychedelic acid rock by nature, but as Smith suggests it really did showcase just how much interest Briggs had in pushing the Alice Cooper band to new creative heights.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While Briggs would never produce another Alice Cooper record, placing an unsuitable producer with an artist is sadly all too common within the industry. In this instance, however, we can blame naivety and Shep Gordon, Cooper’s longtime manager, for asking David Briggs to produce <em>Easy Action</em> following the underproduced effort <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/artist/frank-zappa/458712"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Frank Zappa</span></a> put into <em>Pretties for You; </em>an album that was essentially composed of rehearsal material. Gordon described to Marc Maron<a href="https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/tag/Shep+Gordon">²</a> that following a chance meeting with Briggs, and upon explaining the recording process of <em>Pretties for You</em>, was told by Briggs that that is not how music was written and recorded. Being instantly schooled on the matter, Gordon then asked Briggs if he would produce <em>Easy Action</em> to which he agreed. Of course, it was for naught as the record label (Zappa’s Straight Records) refused to use Briggs’ tapes, according to Gordon, instead choosing, again, to use the rehearsal tapes. It makes you wonder, doesn’t it, what Briggs’ tapes would have sounded like and if they’ll ever see the light of day?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Upon reflection, we can see why Zappa’s Straight Records would want to continue with a rough and raw approach because both <em>Pretties for You</em> and <em>Easy Action</em> has unique qualities that are, certainly in my mind, unmatched. However, as is often the case, the plot thickens. In further discussion with Maron, Gordon would proclaim that the rehearsal tapes for <em>Easy Action</em> were used to ensure that the albums would not appeal to a wider audience as Zappa had been given millions by Warner to sign new artists and if they failed to be a success, he wouldn’t have to pay out royalties. Ridiculous, yes, but not uncommon!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block gallery-block sqs-block-gallery" data-block-json="&#123;&quot;existingGallery&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;methodOption&quot;:&quot;transient&quot;,&quot;aspect-ratio&quot;:&quot;square&quot;,&quot;aspectRatio&quot;:null,&quot;auto-crop&quot;:true,&quot;blockAnimation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;collectionId&quot;:&quot;61ee1fb07618b227cf424dc7&quot;,&quot;design&quot;:&quot;grid&quot;,&quot;lightbox&quot;:true,&quot;lightboxTheme&quot;:&quot;light&quot;,&quot;padding&quot;:20,&quot;show-meta&quot;:true,&quot;show-meta-basic&quot;:true,&quot;show-meta-only-title&quot;:false,&quot;show-meta-only-description&quot;:false,&quot;square-thumbs&quot;:false,&quot;thumbnails-per-row&quot;:4,&quot;vSize&quot;:null,&quot;transientGalleryId&quot;:&quot;61ee1fb07618b227cf424dc7&quot;&#125;" data-block-type="8" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642984497620_48269"><div class="sqs-block-content">

One could argue that they’re getting better, but the 2009 vinyl re-issue certainly does not fall into that category and should be avoided at all costs. Sonically it’s a mess. It has a decent soundstage and clear stereo separation on several tracks but is a muffled mess on others. Yes, the earlier Alice Cooper albums have a raw and unpolished feel to them that borders on garage rock, but when comparing it directly to the lossless Apple Music stream, I prefer the latter for it offers a more consistent sound which is less fatiguing to listen to.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, the original gatefold design was omitted, most likely as a cost-saving measure, and those cheap rice paper sleeves that the record shipped in are an insult to every serious music lover. The ghastly green marble coloured vinyl, however, is this collector’s worst nightmare.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is correct, or incorrect as the case may be, is the tracklisting on the rear vinyl sleeve whereby Lay Down and Die, Goodbye is the second to last track. This error seems to be present on all original releases that I’ve looked at via <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/52891-Alice-Cooper-Easy-Action"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Discogs</span></a> but the error has been rectified on the most recent reissues from 2018 that include the gatefold design. While the Alice Cooper fan within would love to pick up one of the 2018 reissues, it is a case of once bitten twice shy and as much as I appreciate having a complete collection, <em>Easy Action</em> sounds fantastic on Apple Music; hence I feel the stream will suffice.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642984497620_31990"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="610" style="width:100%;max-width:1400px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/au/album/easy-action/78981314"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642984497620_99135"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Mr. &amp; Misdemeanor </strong>opens <em>Easy Action</em> with somewhat of a more focused vocal style whereby Cooper’s signature growl makes its first appearance. Even the overall musicality of the band, which would be refined in future records, comes through clearly when listening to Mr. &amp; Misdemeanor thereby making it a solid starting point for the Alice Cooper style of music they’d become most recognised for. Perhaps the greatest failing here is the mix isn’t the best as it sounds rather concealed in places. It’s as if there’s an exceptional tune waiting to be unleashed but one that is simultaneously being held back.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Shoe Salesman </strong>has a <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/?category=The+Beatles"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Beatles</span></a>’ influence that I simply adore. Whether or not it was intentional is irrelevant for it makes the song a standout on the album and is one tune that I would have loved to have heard the fab four record.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Still No Air </strong>is weird, even for the Alice Cooper band. It does have one redeeming quality, however, where the lyric ‘When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way’ is reused on the groovy <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/gutter-cat-vs-the-jets/40458557?i=40458567"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Gutter Cat vs. The Jets</span></a>. This isn’t the only time Alice Cooper would self-plagiarise, for it has also occurred on Refrigerator Heaven and <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/alice-cooper-pretties-for-you-album-review"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reflected</span></a>, but in all cases, the reimaginations offered a worthwhile improvement.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Below Your Means </strong>has a <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/artist/the-doors/1248588"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Doors</span></a>’ sound signature that could be perfectly suited to either band. The bluesy guitar work on this song is glorious making for an overall pleasurable rhythmic experience. I would have loved to have heard Alice Cooper re-record this song with Bob Ezrin as I swear it could have been a stadium filling tune. Nevertheless, Alice would take a backseat here with Michael Bruce taking the vocal reins in a wonderful performance that is only bested by Beautiful Flyaway.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Return of the Spiders </strong>sees a return to Cooper’s gruff vocal that we all know and love; albeit with a little less polish than on Mr. &amp; Misdemeanor. The musical accompaniment, however, fails to impress for the improv style would work well in a live setting but is somewhat lacking in a studio environment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Laughing At Me </strong>can be seen, from a musical perspective, as a precursor to Desperado with specific regard to the tuning and twang of the guitar. An incredible song that all fans should listen to and have in their collection.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Refrigerator Heaven </strong>is one of those short and sweet songs that are quirky, yet addictively compelling. While the band or Alice himself wouldn’t perform any songs from <em>Easy Action </em>live, following the supporting tour for <em>Love It to Death</em>, he did rehash the lyrical quote Refrigerator Heaven on his first solo album, <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2020/1/30/alice-cooper-welcome-to-my-nightmare-album-review-on-vinyl-amp-apple-music"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Welcome to My Nightmare</em></span></a><em>, </em>on the song <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/cold-ethyl/355055007?i=355055266"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cold Ethyl</span></a>; a song that would continue to be on the live setlist throughout the decades<em>.&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Beautiful Flyaway </strong>has a killer piano introduction by Michael Bruce. Bruce also performs lead vocals on Beautiful Flyaway, but you’d be forgiven if you  missed that aspect as his vocal isn’t too dissimilar to Alice’s although a little smoother. While Bruce would go on to have modest success post-band breakup, he never really received the recognition he deserved for Beautiful Flyaway is one of the best songs on <em>Easy Action</em> and, in my opinion, is a vocal masterpiece that is often overlooked.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Lay Down and Die, Goodbye </strong>isn’t good but there are killer rock and roll elements placed throughout. Let’s just say that Bob Ezrin did a wonderful job when he stripped down not only Alice Cooper's sound but the over-the-top nonsensical musical experimentation.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Overall,<em> Easy Action </em>has some incredible tracks but I remain undecided if it is best listened to as a series of individual songs, selected at random and based on personal preference, or if it needs to be experienced in the album format. Perhaps I’ll never know and surprisingly I’m okay with not being able to pigeonhole <em>Easy Action,</em> for the internal conflict ensures that I’ll listen to, and enjoy, the album for many more years to come; just not via the 2009 vinyl reissue.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642984497620_32667"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/?category=Alice+Cooper">Check out more Alice Cooper reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642984497620_33454"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Offering music lovers soaring guitars to a melodic rock rhythm should have cemented their success but it wasn’t to be. A shame, yes, but thankfully streaming gives us all an opportunity to find an album, and a band, that otherwise would never have been on our radar.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange and engineered and mixed by Mick Glossop, <em>City Boy </em>is an astonishing recording that has been mixed with pure perfection and would help cement these two behind-the-boards masters’ careers. Lange would not only produce City Boy’s first five albums but would go on to produce some of the biggest albums in music history; most notably AC/DC’s <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/back-in-black/574050396"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Back In Black</em></span></a>, Foreigner‘s <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/4-expanded-version-2002-remaster/285143156"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>4</em></span></a>, and Def Leppard’s <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/pyromania/1440902935"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Pyromania</em></span></a><em>. </em>Of course, Lange would branch out beyond rock and produce Shania Twain’s masterpiece, <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2020/7/10/shania-twain-come-on-over-album-review-on-cd?rq=shania%20"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Come On Over</em></span></a><em>. </em>With such a legacy, and <em>City Boy </em>being one of his first outings in the producer’s chair, one would rightly wonder how much of his legacy can be heard on these early recordings, but one need not worry for <em>City Boy</em> has a level of spit and polish that, arguably, couldn’t have been realised by the band themselves. That isn’t to suggest that City Boy weren’t capable, for a debut this is one astonishing recording of a very tight band, but correlations can and should be made between Lange’s later works and <em>City Boy </em>for his signature high production style can be easily heard on <em>City Boy.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mick Glossop’s career has been equally impressive with a discography that knows few bounds. Perhaps most impressive, however, is his extensive work with <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/artist/van-morrison/253638"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Van Morrison</span></a> having contributed his production, engineering, and mixing skills to 17 of Morrison’s albums. Either way, <em>City Boy </em>showed that when you get Lange and Glossop working together on a production, magic happens.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, City Boy is more than the production team and the musicians, Lol Mason (lead vocals), Mike Slamer (lead guitar), Steve Broughton (rhythm guitar), Max Thomas (keyboards), Chris Dunn (bass), and Roger Kent (drums) deserve immense credit for <em>City Boy</em> is one of the greatest albums recorded in the 70s; despite sales suggesting otherwise. Their musical prowess mixed with a vocal harmony style makes for a very pleasurable listening experience and of particular note is Mason’s vocal dexterity which is beyond reproach and Mike Slamer’s guitar work that is otherworldly. Slamer is, without doubt, one of the greatest guitarists you’ve, likely, never heard of.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642038861152_42733"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="587" style="width:100%;max-width:1400px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/au/album/city-boy/416412771"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642038861152_89175"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>(Moonlight) Shake My Head and Leave </strong>sets the rhythm immediately, and you’ll be toe-tapping from the very first note, but I’d argue that it’s the weakest song on the album. It’s a little campy in its structure but stick with it for the song opens up with some divine guitar soloing.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Deadly Delicious </strong>reminds me instantly of Skyhooks and I can’t help but wonder if the Australian natives had an influence on City Boy with <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/skyhooks-living-in-the-70s-album-review"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Living In The 70’s</em></span></a> predating <em>City Boy </em>by two years. I don’t know about you, but I can even hear a Shirley Strachan styled vocal delivery. That correlation aside, Deadly Delicious is a pure psychedelic rock masterpiece that really highlights Lol Mason’s vocal capabilities. There is, however, a percussive element mid-song that has a Caribbean wind-chime like sound that I find to be distracting, particularly as it’s a jarring aspect when contrasted with the other musical elements. It doesn’t ruin the song, but I would have preferred that element to be omitted.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Surgery Hours (Doctor Doctor) </strong>will have you grooving and like Deadly Delicious is indicative of the 70s sound. Surgery Hours (Doctor Doctor) would have been perfect for a single release, in my opinion, but I also hope that a modern hip hop artist comes across the song and chooses to sample its addictive hook.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Sunset Boulevard </strong>slows the tempo but as a classic rock tune, Sunset Boulevard is sensational, rivalling the very best and most popular songs of the era. Honestly, how this album, and particularly this song, was never admired by the broader music-loving public is beyond belief. It just goes to show that sales success isn’t an indication of quality. Absolutely magnificent!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Oddball Dance </strong>is so much fun. It’s quirky but is so addictive that I find myself putting Oddball Dance on repeat every time it comes on. It has everything one could want from a song: soaring guitars, killer bass and drum rhythm, magnificent percussive elements, and a lyrical presentation that is not only soothing but energetic. The interlude, however, can take you out of the song, but it doesn’t last long and when the song returns to its original path it’s a momentous moment.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>5000 Years / Don't Know Can't Tell </strong>is another song that showcases just how solid City Boy already was despite this being their debut release. The skill present on this song, and many others on the album, would arguably be reserved for artists with a much greater legacy to fall back on, but in the two years prior to this recording, these master musicians honed their art to such an extent that it defies belief. If you haven’t yet done so, may I recommend you turn the volume knob to the right when 5000 Years / Don't Know Can't Tell comes on. You won’t regret it!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Hap-Ki-Do Kid </strong>has a diverse musical style that works surprisingly well as it takes influence from multiple genres. In fact, much of City Boy’s music is so genre-busting that one would rightly hear correlations from various artists, styles, and genres of music when listening to City Boy<em>.</em> Ultimately, it’s a fun tune but after the almost nine-minute behemoth that was 5000 Years / Don't Know Can't Tell it almost feels as though The Hap-Ki-Do Kid ends prematurely.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Greatest Story Ever Told </strong>is, arguably, the greatest song ever recorded. Okay, perhaps that is overreaching a little but it is a masterpiece that, without doubt, would be in my Top 100 70s Classic Rock playlist; if I had such a playlist, of course. The mix is perfect and the flow between the verses and chorus is the definition of perfection. Every musical element is perfectly presented, and the fade-out is utterly brilliant, meaning there isn’t a single aspect of the song that I’d change.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Haymaking Time</strong> is a lovely closing tune, encouraging me to listen to the album again, but I would have loved for The Greatest Story Ever Told to close the album with Haymaking Time being the second to last track. Interestingly, however, I would have been less likely to listen to the album again following The Greatest Story Ever Told as it is a far more contemplative song, from a musical perspective, than Haymaking Time so perhaps the band and the production team got the tracking right in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>City Boy </em>is a timeless masterpiece that not only harps back to the 70s era, but is equally appealing to modern music lovers of classic rock. It is with that thought that I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to appreciate music at a time when almost every recording ever made is readily available for if that wasn’t the case, I would likely have never come across <em>City Boy</em> and you, dear reader, wouldn’t be able to enjoy it while reading this review. Unless, of course, you’re one of their longtime fans and have always known just how good, and under-valued, City Boy really is. At least streaming allows the rest of us to play catch-up for this is one album not to be missed.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642038861152_60448"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/index">Check out more reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642038861152_61138"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Released in 1964, <em>Country Hits…Feelin’ Blue</em> sees Ford, Billy Strange, and John Mosher perform a masterful collection of songs in a stripped-down manner that highlights the vocal, guitar, and bass elements in a way that is often lost on more complex recordings. It is this back-to-basics approach that truly highlights Ford’s incredible resonant baritone vocal; a vocal that has to be heard to be believed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I listen to the CD-quality lossless Apple Music stream, I’m left in awe. While <em>Country Hits…Feelin’ Blue</em> never made it to CD, the stream provided by Capitol Records is beyond reproach and is so good that I’m questioning if I need to consider the 2020 vinyl reissue from Analogue Productions. Vinyl aficionados will undoubtedly point to the additional warmth of the vinyl record that would work exceedingly well with this type of music, but the Apple Music lossless stream is anything but cold and shrill, and really has a sense of presence. As much as I appreciate the Analogue Productions re-issues, such as Aaron Neville’s <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/aaron-neville-warm-your-heart-album-review"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Warm Your Heart</em></span></a><em>, </em>I can’t find fault in the streamed offering. It’s that good!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1636419747463_25763"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/country-hits-feelin-blue/1577450630?app=music&amp;itsct=music_box_player&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1" height="715px" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; overflow: hidden; border-top-left-radius: 10px; border-top-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-left-radius: 10px; background-color: transparent;"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1637897373706_23491"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Try Me One More Time </strong>is searching for redemption in a classic love gone awry manner that is iconic to country music. Ford sells it incredibly well making the listener believe that it is indeed him who is asking for another chance.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>No Letter Today </strong>is such a sad song of longing for a beloved. Yes, some may consider <em>Country Hits…Feelin’ Blue </em>to be akin to a suicide-inducing album, due to the sombreness of the songs, but the wittiness in its storytelling is appealing and so it depends on how you choose to listen to this record as the glass-half filled individual will undoubtedly experience it differently to those who declare it as being half empty.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Born To Lose </strong>showcases just how smooth Ford’s vocal is. This is one song that can be fully appreciated sans lyrical intent for the uninspiring meaning of Born To Lose is most certainly overshadowed by the exceptional vocal elements that become an instrument rather than a storytelling device. Of course, you may prefer to listen to the lyrics, that’s up to you, but I prefer, in this case, to be swept away with vocal awe.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Don’t Rob Another Man’s Castle </strong>is utterly brilliant and is one of the best songs on <em>Country Hits…Feelin’ Blue</em>. It’s droll, yet still relevant. A timeless classic!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>There’ll Be No Teardrops Tonight </strong>picks up the tempo a little; a great toe-tapping song! Strange’s guitar tracking here is out-of-this-world as it’s unpretentious yet authoritative in driving the song forward. Hank Williams would have been proud!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Don’t Hurt Anymore </strong>is a solid tune. Although, I’d say that Ford pushed his vocal a little too far on this song for the resonance is just a little jarring on the senses. It’s a fine line, of course, but it is just a step too far for my liking.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Worried Mind </strong>is an upright bass player’s dream come true. The holding back of the guitar is also a masterful approach as the song continues to build throughout. It’s upbeat, and you’ll find yourself toe-tapping and head-bopping to this classic, ironically without a worry in the world for the musicality will captivate your soul.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>No One Will Ever Know </strong>is an intriguing song filled with conflicts of emotion and love. It presents an interesting dichotomy but is indicative of how many of us would love to move on from a relationship; silently and without explanation or justification.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Funny How Time Slips Away </strong>is a country music standard that has been recorded by numerous musicians over the years. As a Willie Nelson authored tune, it would be logical to suggest that <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/funny-how-time-slips-away/1443134445?i=1443134921"><span style="text-decoration:underline">his recording</span></a> is the one to go for. Yes, his rendition is admirable but there are so many thoroughly good renditions, including this one by Ford, that it is really difficult to pin down the best interpretation. If you have time, I recommend you check out the <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/funny-how-time-slips-away/1440902457?i=1440902674"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Glen Campbell &amp; Willy Nelson duet</span></a> or <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/funny-how-time-slips-away/257540283?i=257541624"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Elvis Presley’s recording</span></a>, but I would stay clear of <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/funny-how-time-slips-away/724544608?i=724544921"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Bryan Ferry’s bastardisation</span></a> of this classic tune.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Sweet Dreams </strong>is a little dry. It’s still a great tune but fails to leave a lasting impression.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tears On My Pillow </strong>maintains the overall blue feeling of the album but is a great tune with a brilliant verse and chorus structure.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>May You Never Be Alone </strong>closes out the album admirably. It’s another that Hank Williams would likely have been proud of for <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/may-you-never-be-alone-single-version/1528119902?i=1528120455"><span style="text-decoration:underline">his rendition</span></a> is excellent in its own right but doesn’t compare to Ford’s soulful masterpiece. May You Never Be Alone encourages me to play the record again, but be warned, repeat listens of this album can result in you feelin’ blue.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From start to finish, <em>Country Hits…Feelin’ Blue</em> is an exceptional album that will appeal to anyone who appreciates an acoustic vocal-focused musical experience. Is it one of the greatest country albums of the 60s? Absolutely! Although, I’d go as far as saying that it’s one of the greatest country music albums ever recorded and that it should be in everyone’s collection. If nothing else, it is arguably the very best work of Ford’s illustrious career.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1636419747463_26826"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/index">Check out more reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1636419747463_26394"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Since then, I've always listened out for Neville's uniquely soulful vocals as there really isn’t anyone quite like him.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Released in 1991, <em>Warm Your Heart</em> is arguably Neville’s greatest musical achievement. Of course, Neville will warm your heart with this incredible release, but finding a definitive edition proved to be challenging.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Warm Your Heart </em>had, of course, been recorded, mixed, and mastered with kid gloves, but I always found the original CD release to be a little less soulful than I’d like. It was a little shrill in places and a little too clean. The lossless CD-quality Apple Music stream similarly maintains the sonic brilliance of the recording, but the tonal warmth that makes this album so exciting and pleasurable to listen to was largely absent. Yes, that crisper sound signature may appeal to some listeners, but what I really needed was a vinyl copy with the warmth that only an analog format can deliver.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Unfortunately, I missed the 2013 vinyl re-issue by Original Recordings Group and while I had considered the SACD release, I decided that it was time to focus my attention on a <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/features/too-many-records-a-music-lovers-journey-to-cull-a-physical-media-collection"><span style="text-decoration:underline">singular format; plus streaming</span></a>. Subsequently, when Analogue Productions reissued <em>Warm Your Heart </em>in 2020, I simply had to pick up a copy as it was one of my holy grail records.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block gallery-block sqs-block-gallery" data-block-json="&#123;&quot;existingGallery&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;methodOption&quot;:&quot;transient&quot;,&quot;aspect-ratio&quot;:&quot;square&quot;,&quot;aspectRatio&quot;:null,&quot;auto-crop&quot;:true,&quot;blockAnimation&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;collectionId&quot;:&quot;600b7149872c446e5a064d46&quot;,&quot;design&quot;:&quot;grid&quot;,&quot;lightbox&quot;:true,&quot;lightboxTheme&quot;:&quot;light&quot;,&quot;padding&quot;:20,&quot;show-meta&quot;:true,&quot;show-meta-basic&quot;:true,&quot;show-meta-only-title&quot;:false,&quot;show-meta-only-description&quot;:false,&quot;square-thumbs&quot;:false,&quot;thumbnails-per-row&quot;:3,&quot;vSize&quot;:null,&quot;transientGalleryId&quot;:&quot;600b7149872c446e5a064d46&quot;&#125;" data-block-type="8" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611287677308_224658"><div class="sqs-block-content">

Yes, this release has a hype sticker that promises this and that but in this case, you can believe every word printed for this is how vinyl should sound. Detailed, smooth, and enveloping with an incredibly low noise floor ensuring that you will be swept away with the music. While it’s audacious to proclaim that this is how the artist intended it, I can say without a doubt that I’ve never heard the album sound better. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pressed at Kassem’s Quality Record Pressings pressing plant, <em>Warm Your Heart </em>is delivered across four sides having been pressed at 45rpm. Yes, it could have been a 33.3rpm release, as the original LP had been, but the track structure and overall flow of the album don’t suffer from a sense of repeated flipping. Perhaps it is that the music is so enjoyable, and the quality is beyond reproach, but despite a shorter runtime on each side, this is one 45rpm record that doesn’t make me feel as if I’m getting up and down continuously.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As with many albums re-issued on audiophile labels, the music isn’t the only thing that is exceptionally well done. The tip-on gatefold jacket by Stoughton Printing is a piece of art in and of itself and while it adds considerable weight to the overall package, this Analogue Productions release is built to last a lifetime as it benefits from additional rigidity. The inner gatefold opens to display the liner notes, sans lyrics, in a highly legible font; an appreciable element for my ageing eyes.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Naturally, both records are presented in the highest quality anti-static inner sleeves and are so flat, and pitch black, that you’ll find yourself staring at them in awe. By now it should go without saying, but the record labels are perfectly centred and presented beautifully. This is most certainly a quality release and while you’ll pay a premium, if you love <em>Warm Your Heart </em>as much as I do, it is worth the investment for no other reason than I’ve found audio nirvana and no longer need to search for a better version.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1623805113952_475605"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="795" style="width:100%;max-width:1400px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/au/album/warm-your-heart/13123689?app=music&at=1l3vtbU"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1623805113952_475690"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Louisiana 1927</strong> is a perfect introduction to the body of work that is <em>Warm Your Heart</em>. Written by the incomparable Randy Newman, his sonic cues are most certainly present throughout, but it is the historical story of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, from the perspective of an unknown individual, that makes this a moving lament. <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/louisiana-1927/51957158?i=51957181"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Newman recorded it himself in 1974</span></a> and while Neville’s version is similar, Neville took it to new levels. It isn’t that Newman’s version is lacklustre, but Neville made it his own and his alone is the definitive recording of this beautiful song. That said, <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/louisiana-1927/1443220009?i=1443220728"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Russell Watson</span></a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/louisiana-1927/210997022?i=210997024"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Gary Brown</span></a>, and <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/louisiana-1927/296151301?i=296151328"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Marcia Ball</span></a> have all performed it beautifully within their respective vocal range.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Everybody Plays The Fool</strong> has a fantastic mix of soul and funk and Neville presents a smoother interpretation than <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/everybody-plays-the-fool/304819235?i=304819349"><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Main Ingredient’s original recording</span></a>. Of course, I would have loved to have heard Bob Marley record this tune as there’s a definite reggae groove lurking just below the surface but as that never happened, to my knowledge, Neville’s is the best interpretation of this song to date.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>It Feels Like Rain</strong> is simply gorgeous. Just listen and you’ll hear incredible musical layering with every element being transparent, ensuring nothing is concealed. This is how music should sound!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Somewhere Somebody</strong> has a killer groove that is perfectly recorded. Topically the search for love is highly relatable but at no time does Somewhere Somebody come across as your typical clichéd love song, it’s much more than that. Take a listen for yourself and you’ll understand what I mean.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Don't Go Please Stay</strong> is a beautiful song with a gorgeous classical choral overlay. That said, I don’t like the audible jolt when the song starts following Somewhere Somebody, but that is a minor quibble as all is forgotten as the song moves through the first verse.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>With You In Mind</strong> is astonishingly good. Allen Toussaint wrote a masterful song and Neville, as is the case throughout <em>Warm Your Heart</em>, makes the song his own. Although, if you have the time may I suggest you give <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/with-you-in-mind-remastered/1204357976?i=1204358168"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Toussaint’s original recording</span></a> a listen; it’s that good and I really can’t decide which version I prefer, not that I really want to make that determination anyway.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>That's The Way She Loves</strong> is one of the greatest songs ever written and recorded, by any artist. As with With You In Mind, Allen Toussaint also penned this tune and Neville and co made it a masterpiece.&nbsp;That's The Way She Loves is so compelling, from a musical perspective, that it is one of those songs that I use to audition new gear because I know exactly how I would like it to sound and therefore it assists me to make sure that any investment is an improvement.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Angola Bound</strong> is a little jolting after That's The Way She Loves. Thankfully, due to the 45rpm pressing’s need to flip, the shift between songs is less noticeable but if you’re streaming you’ll definitely notice it. It isn’t that Angola Bound is a bad song, it is just poorly positioned on the record.<strong> </strong>If I were doing the tracking, I’d likely have placed Angola Bound after Everybody Plays The Fool.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Close Your Eyes</strong> is a beautiful duet with <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/linda-ronstadt/148850?itsct=music_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ct=artists_linda_ronstadt&amp;ls=1&amp;app=music"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Linda Ronstadt</span></a>. Ronstadt was also the producer of the album and she did a fantastic job in my opinion. While Close Your Eyes doesn’t compare to <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/dont-know-much-feat-ag-thomas-aaron-neville/1028814908?i=1028814924"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Don’t Know Much</span></a>, it’s wonderful that these two master musicians collaborated on more than a single song for they’re so perfectly matched. Of the numerous other renditions of Close Your Eyes, the only one that comes close is that recorded by <a href="https://music.apple.com/au/album/close-your-eyes/734660085?i=734660253"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Earl Lewis and The Channels in 1973</span></a>. It’s perfect for the era it was recorded in but Close Your Eyes is another example of Neville taking a lovely tune and, with the help of Ronstadt, making it a timeless classic.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>La Vie Dansante</strong> is a lovely tune, with a Caribbean style, and exceptional backing vocals that complement Neville’s lead vocal perfectly.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Warm Your Heart</strong> is a solid track, but perhaps not one to write home about. It suits the album well, however, but I don’t believe it was strong enough to be the title track.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Bid You Goodnight</strong> is a beautiful vocal-focused ballad that is amplified significantly by the magnificent intermingling backing vocals; a perfect mix.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Ave Maria</strong> needs no introduction. Neville pays respect to the song, and its legacy, and despite being&nbsp;covered by some of the very best vocalists the world has ever heard, Neville’s version would undoubtedly be in my Top 10.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Streaming Bonus Track:</strong></span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	<strong>House On A Hill</strong> is a toe-tapping, head-bopping, song that is slightly jolting following the relaxed nature of Ave Maria, but it is so good that I don't mind the shifting style. However, I am happy to report that it wasn’t included on the vinyl release as I feel Ave Maria is the perfect closer for <em>Warm Your Heart. </em>Similarly, it wasn’t featured on the original CD release but as a streaming-only and CD-reissue addition, I consider it to be a value-added proposition for fans.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Warm Your Heart</em> is superb from start to finish and should be in every music lover’s collection. If you can, I’d encourage you to pick up the Analogue Productions re-issue, but rest assured that this album is so good that it doesn’t matter which format/method you choose to enjoy it via; it’s a masterpiece!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1621300600524_236969"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/search?q=aaron%20neville">Check out more Aaron Neville reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p>

Yes, there are a couple of songs that I don’t feel suit Meat Loaf’s vocal style, but if you give it a chance, <em>Hang Cool Teddy Bear </em>is a great rock album that is worthy of the Meat Loaf moniker. Of course, Meat Loaf is more than a singular entity and the lineup of collaborators in this 2010 release is impressive, although, no music is featured from Meat Loaf’s long-time collaborator, Jim Steinman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As for the recording, mix, and mastering of <em>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</em>, it’s LOUD! That isn’t necessarily a bad thing for it works well with the style of the album, but you’ll likely find yourself turning the volume down and listening at lower levels to prevent listener fatigue. Thankfully, even though the album is dynamically compromised, it hasn’t been compressed to the extent that elements, such as cymbals, are crunching unnaturally. In that regard, Ted Jensen did an admirable job mastering the album to modern standards.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Similarly commendable is Boris Vallejo’s cover art. There’s just something about fantasy artwork that works so well for album covers. Naturally, while the music is the most important aspect, pictures can tell a thousand words and in this case, you can take from the artwork what you want. All I know is that this would look awesome on a vinyl-sized canvas.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1636365054323_23427"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="760" style="width:100%;max-width:1400px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/au/album/hang-cool-teddy-bear/1443008830"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1636365054323_24676"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Peace On Earth</strong> isn’t the greatest tune to launch the album on, for the introduction is somewhat pointless and the tempo is a little too upbeat for Meat Loaf. Also of note is Meat Loaf’s lyrical style that appears to be a merging of himself, Lou Reed, and Johnny Cash. Does it work? I’m not sure it does, but you grow to accept it as it also makes an appearance on Living On The Outside. Regardless, while I’d suggest that the verses are a little chaotic, I thoroughly enjoy the delivery of the chorus.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Living On The Outside</strong>, similarly to Peace On Earth, has a great chorus but a somewhat inconsistent verse structure. Nevertheless, Living On The Outside is catchy, with a solid rhythm, and some killer guitar licks.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Los Angeloser</strong> should have opened <em>Hang Cool Teddy Bear. </em>An<em> </em>utterly brilliant and witty tune! You’ll be head-bopping and toe-tapping from the very first note and its literal meaning is reminiscent, in my mind, of Alice Cooper’s <a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/album/lost-in-america/169654473?i=169655162&amp;itsct=music_box_link&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1&amp;app=music"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Lost In America</span></a>. The combination of James Michael and Meat Loaf has struck again and I don’t know about you, but I would love to see these two collaborate on a future record in the same way as Jim Steinman and Meat Loaf collaborated.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Despite being the first single from <em>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</em>, Los Angeloser failed to gain traction in the charts; a shame considering it is arguably the best song on the album and most certainly should be in Meat Loaf’s career highlight reel. However, one can’t help but wonder if the quirky <a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/music-video/los-angeloser/367762306?itsct=music_box_link&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1&amp;app=music"><span style="text-decoration:underline">music video</span></a> played a role in its lacklustre success with the only redeeming factor being Meat Loaf’s role as the preacher. Alas, we’ll never know!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>If I Can't Have You</strong> <strong>(feat. Kara DioGuardi and Hugh Laurie)</strong> had the potential to be another <a href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/musicblog/2019/2/13/meat-loaf-bat-out-of-hell-ii-back-into-hell-album-review"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won‘t Do That)</span></a>, albeit with a faster tempo. The dynamic range, however, is a little shallow resulting in a smaller and more compressed soundstage that hides not only the backing vocals but Hugh Laurie’s piano elements throughout much of the song. DioGuardi’s vocal, however, is simply gorgeous and spot on.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Love Is Not Real/Next Time You Stab Me In The Back</strong> has an enjoyable backbeat and overall rhythm, but it is Brian May and Steve Vai's intermingling guitar solo that makes this song truly memorable.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Like A Rose</strong> is one of the best songs on <em>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</em> and is one of my all-time favourite Meat Loaf tracks. In part, it’s due to Jack Black’s involvement but the tip of the hat to the Beastie Boys takes Like A Rose to another level. If there was one aspect that I’d change, it would be the mix. The guitar is simply too concealed and if it was more forward in the mix, and turned up by a few decibels, Like A Rose would be a guaranteed rock anthem. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Song Of Madness</strong> is one tune that you’ll want to pump the volume on. Not only is Steve Vai’s guitar work masterful but Meat Loaf pushes his vocals beautifully, ensuring his signature smooth highs and guttural lows are prominent throughout. But, that bass tracking, by Chris Chaney, is what dreams are made of. A killer heavy metal-inspired tune!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Did You Ever Love Somebody</strong> slows the album down a little, but this isn’t your usual Meat Loaf ballad. It sounds, from a vocal perspective, like a demo as Meat Loaf’s full range isn’t on display here but that is also, strangely, part of its appeal. Did You Ever Love Somebody, however, could have been a masterpiece if a little more spit and polish had been applied. That introduction and gradual build, though, is magical.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>California Isn't Big Enough (Hey There Girl)</strong> is a rock song, with 80s synth elements, amongst a cascade of other styles, resulting in a compelling, yet confusing, composition. I enjoy the chorus, but as with a couple of other songs on <em>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</em> the chorus is where this song shines.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Running Away From Me</strong> is a classic B-side. It was never going to be a hit, but I like it.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Let's Be In Love</strong> isn't a bad song, but is made significantly better thanks to Patti Russo. Again, Meat Loaf's vocal presence feels lacklustre, especially in the quiet passages, but given the love song styling it could be suggested that his vocal is intentionally vulnerable. Nevertheless, in comparison, Russo's Vocal takes the song to another level and it’s just disappointing that Russo doesn’t enter the mix until around the midway point of the song.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>If It Rains</strong> is a great song but I would love to hear it with a slightly faster tempo and a little more edginess.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Elvis In Vegas</strong> is a great closer but as good as Meat Loaf performs it, I’d love to hear Jon Bon Jovi record it as he co-wrote it with Desmond Child and Billy Falcon. A great song, regardless.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Hang Cool Teddy Bear</em> is likely no one’s first choice when listening to Meat Loaf, but it is underrated and is deserving of more attention as there is some thoroughly enjoyable music to be heard here. If you haven’t had a chance to check it out, I hope this review convinces you to give it a chance. Give it a few plays, particularly in the background, and you may be surprised just how much the entire album grows on you.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1622594667860_140479"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/?category=Meat+Loaf">Check out more Meat Loaf reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1622594667860_141975"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Subsequently, it showcases a level of artistry that has evolved beyond core elements alone and sees RÜFÜS DU SOL further advance their unique sound that will continue to set them apart from their contemporaries.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Surrender </em>is also their first album delivered in Dolby Atmos. Compared to the already immersive, and utterly impressive, stereo mix, the Dolby Atmos edition gives a fuller sound. If you’re using headphones, such as Apple’s AirPods Pro, you’ll thoroughly enjoy the experience over the standard stereo mix for you’ll feel enveloped in the music. That said, via speakers, I find the stereo mix is the stronger of the two so it comes down to how you like to listen to music. Perhaps the Dolby Atmos edition is best described as different, rather than better, but you’ll really notice the benefits of the surround mix on songs such as See You Again, On My Knees, and Surrender.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1634963719549_523672"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/surrender/1585865534?app=music&amp;itsct=music_box_player&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1" height="690px" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; overflow: hidden; border-top-left-radius: 10px; border-top-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-left-radius: 10px; background-color: transparent;"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1635219687521_12631"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Next To Me </strong>has a masterful haunting piano opening that, remains central to the mix as the soundstage builds. It’s a stunning opener, but perhaps the greatest sense of imagery comes from the lyrics:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And when the lights come down</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to feel you standing next to me</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As someone with two left feet, and therefore not a clubbing enthusiast, it would be easy to dismiss the meaning behind these lyrics, but in our modern era, where music is not as easily experienced in person, Next To Me reaches into your soul and when the beat drops you’ll feel the intended emotional elements.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Make It Happen </strong>is one of those unique love songs that many of us would long for; having found the one we love earlier in life if only to have spent more time in pure emotional bliss. Initially, the children’s choir approach to the chorus seemed a little campy, but the more I listen to Make It Happen, the more I see the innocence and intent in this style. Plus, it strangely works perfectly with the musicality that will have you moving involuntarily to the rhythm.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>See You Again </strong>has a sense of positivity that is needed in an uncertain world. The layering of music, while indicative of this form of musical art, is extraordinarily tight here with every element perfectly positioned, resulting in an immersive soundstage that will amaze you as it envelops you.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Don’t Wanna Leave </strong>has a slightly slower tempo compared to some of the other songs on the album, yet the authority of the music remains as it slowly builds. It may not instantly get the dance floor shaking, but will certainly be memorable as I Don’t Wanna Leave is one of the best songs on <em>Surrender</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Alive </strong>is a masterpiece, both musically and lyrically, and was rightfully the lead single from <em>Surrender</em>. It is one of those songs that allows the listener to decide how they choose to interpret meaning and while some may point to its moodier tone, I prefer to look at the positive aspects of the song acknowledging, all the while, that at least I’m alive.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Alive (Reprise) </strong>is a lovely musical-only interlude. Is it necessary? Well, no, but if it were to open Side 2 of the upcoming vinyl counterpart, then it acts as a connective element.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>On My Knees </strong>is gripping. The beat, the vocal aspects, the overall musicality, will get you moving even if you’re, a little more reserved like I am, meaning that On My Knees is not only an exceptional song but one of the best by RÜFÜS DU SOL and one that will be, in my opinion, a landmark track in the alternate dance genre as it’s an evolution of the art.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Wildfire </strong>is an interesting song that never really arrives, despite the slow build. It is intentional, no doubt, but does it work? Subjectively, I don’t think so, but your opinion may likely differ.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Surrender </strong>is incredibly multi-layered and takes a few listens to connect with the song beyond its backbeat. It’s beautiful and perfectly suited as the title track and as it slowly builds, the listener is taken on a journey that can only be described as a genesis moment.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Devotion </strong>isn’t a bad tune but I’d class it as album filler as it’s somewhat predictable and doesn’t forge new ground.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Always </strong>is the culmination of all that has come before and, as the closing track, it encourages me to listen to <em>Surrender </em>again. As with many songs on the album, the concept is based on despondency but as the song builds it delivers a sense of hope. Given the times at which this album was recorded, and the world it enters into upon its release, this is the kind of message that we all need more than ever before. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Surrender </em>is so addictive that I can’t help but put it on repeat. I want more, yet the 53-minute runtime is absolutely perfect ensuring that I leave the album feeling rejoiced, empowered, and relaxed. If the aim of music is to allow music-lovers to feel emotion, then the trio that is RÜFÜS DU SOL have transcended themselves on <em>Surrender</em> to achieve that very result.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1635219687521_14209"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/index">Check out more reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1635219687521_15140"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Yes, some would reflect on Lennon’s musical approach and suggest that it is too similar to his father’s musical style, but I honestly consider Julian Lennon to be completely independent of John Lennon and while there may be correlations I’d argue that Julian’s musical prowess on <em>Photograph Smile</em> is superior to his father’s and that is coming from someone who is in awe of John Lennon and his legacy.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597542289809_47483"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/photograph-smile/715106349?app=music&amp;itsct=music_box_player&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1" height="770px" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; overflow: hidden; border-top-left-radius: 10px; border-top-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-left-radius: 10px; background-color: transparent;"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1634787189435_197644"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Day After Day </strong>is a fantastic tune, but the abrupt opening has always irritated me, for you’re not necessarily expecting it. Nevertheless, it’s a great start to the album and is a lovely composition that will have you toe-tapping and head-bopping throughout. There’s also a little guitar element, around the 3-minute mark, that reminds me of Lynyrd Skynyrd’s <a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/album/free-bird/1440838012?app=music&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;i=1440838661&amp;itscg=30200&amp;itsct=music_box_link&amp;ls=1"><em>Free Bird</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Cold </strong>has an incredible soundstage and the level of vocal and instrumental distortion is absolutely perfect. The tempo is well suited to the song and the included acoustic guitar is simply beautiful. Without a doubt, Cold is one of the best songs on the album!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Should Have Known </strong>is one of the many songs on <em>Photograph Smile</em> that I know by heart and never tire of. The chorus compels me to sing along; an activity that I find myself doing throughout the entire album. While it suits the mood of the song, if there was one criticism to be made it would be that the muddiness in the lows can be a little distracting when listening via headphones.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>How Many Times </strong>is a great song but if there was one tune that I’d skip when listening to the album, it would likely be this one. It’s arguably longer than it needs to be and doesn’t push the creative envelope far enough to stand out from most of the pop/rock songs from the era. That said, the meaning behind Lennon’s lyrics here is admirable and when listening from that perspective, one can have a different opinion.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Don’t Wanna Know </strong>is a fun track and sometimes that is all you need.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Crucified </strong>is a little left of the centre when compared to the tracks that preceded it. It’s sonically bold, perhaps a little too bold, but if you can get past the stylistic shift, it isn’t a bad tune.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Walls </strong>is simply beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Believe </strong>is perfectly suited to closing your eyes and allowing your body to flow back and forth to the rhythm. It’s hypnotic and utterly addictive.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Good To Be Lonely </strong>is a lovely song.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Kiss Beyond The Catcher </strong>is a cool tune with arguably one of the most interesting song titles I’ve ever come across.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>And She Cries </strong>is one of my favourite songs on <em>Photograph Smile</em>; a song that I could listen to on repeat for hours as Lennon’s vocals are absolutely perfect on this recording.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Photograph Smile </strong>is hauntingly beautiful as it’s musically stripped-down allowing Lennon’s incredible vocal to sit prominently in front of, and on top of, the music. This is what good music should sound like.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Faithful </strong>flows perfectly from Photograph Smile and is another beautiful song with a lovely connotation. <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/gemma-hayes/5171139?itsct=music_box_link&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1&amp;app=music"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Gemma Hayes’</span></a> backing/duet vocals here are also magnificent.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Way To Your Heart </strong>is a great closer, compelling me to listen to the album again, but the faux vinyl record surface noise only reminds me that <em>Photograph Smile</em> was never released on vinyl and while I have my fingers crossed for a one-off vinyl pressing, it’s likely wishful thinking on my part.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Photograph Smile</em> may not have been wildly successful when it was released, but if commercial success was the ultimate indicator of quality music, then art as we know it has no future. <em>Photograph Smile</em> is truly a hidden gem and would be a welcome addition to any music lover’s collection as it is Lennon’s greatest musical achievement. Hence, if there’s only one Julian Lennon album that you add to your collection, make it this one.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1621463654747_224923"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/index">Check out more reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597542289809_48482"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Add to that the compelling psychedelic artwork and you’ve got yourself an extraordinary piece of musical art that, in my mind at least, talks to the true nature of alternative music in its attempt to challenge what music is and what it can be. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1635229981020_33382"><div class="sqs-block-content"><iframe src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/oczy-mlody/1164489157?app=music&amp;itsct=music_box_player&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1" height="730px" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; overflow: hidden; border-top-left-radius: 10px; border-top-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-left-radius: 10px; background-color: transparent;"></iframe></div></div><div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1635229981020_33449"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Oczy Mlody</strong> as an instrumental-only tune sets the mood for the entire album. It’s atmospheric with an immersive soundstage that tricks the senses as your mind ebb and flows through the soundscape. It’s uplifting while being simultaneously sombre. I love it!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>How??</strong> starts off beautifully smooth, but while I am a proponent of profanity in music when it is of artistic benefit, I find the first instance of profanity to be disjointed to the overall musicality of the song. Other than that, I would class the song as a vocal and atmospheric masterpiece. The low-bass distortion is particularly pleasing as it doesn’t detract but adds to the depth of the song.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>There Should Be Unicorns</strong> steps up the tempo but retains that gorgeous atmospheric sound. I’m literally held captive by the music, in that special place where we should all be when we are thoroughly enjoying the experience.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Sunrise (Eyes Of The Young)</strong> is perhaps the most experimental track on the album. It shifts direction within the song itself and will appeal to music lovers who appreciate not only musical experimentation but the extreme edges offered by alternative recordings.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Night Nie (Never No)</strong> pans the music from the left and right stereo channels perfectly. You’ll follow the sound around the soundstage as you become immersed in the virtual reality that the artist has created. I adore it, but there are a few audible shocks along the way that prevent you from getting too relaxed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Galaxy I Sink</strong> is sonically cold, distant and isolating in a manner that is somewhat haunting. I do, however, feel that in this case, the lyrics are superfluous as they become a distracting element in an otherwise excellent composition. While I understand this isn’t the approach they were aiming for, it would be fantastic to have an instrumental-only edition of the album as I feel there are two distinct ways this musical art could be appreciated.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>One Night While Hunting For Faeries And Witches And Wizards To Kill</strong> certainly presents a soundstage that is relatable to the song title. The beat, however, is somewhat predictable and the vocal elements are, again, a slight distraction. It is as though the two elements are simply not co-existing cohesively. Of course, one needs to remember that in the spirit of experimental music, this approach is perfectly acceptable.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Do Glowy</strong> seamlessly continues from the previous track but varies the beat and vocal delivery. The vocals in this instance are purposely auto-tuned a little too far, for my liking, but the style works perfectly with the song and I feel that the vocals are once again in synchronicity with the instrumental elements.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Listening To The Frogs With Demon Eyes</strong> offers another seamless transition but is not as demonic as one would assume, considering the song title. The soundstage is also a little too shallow, compared to the rest of the album, especially in the initial elements of the song. It does open up a couple of minutes into the track, but at over 7 minutes in length, there are several changes that will either appeal or become distracting as you listen to Listening To The Frogs With Demon Eyes. Ultimately, it’s an interesting song as I neither like nor dislike it, it merely exists.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Castle</strong>, again, seamlessly transitions between tracks, an aspect I love about listening to <em>Oczy Mlody</em> in the linear album format. Although, I find The Castle to be a little too distorted in the low end and while I’d say that this has been done purposefully, as it is consistent throughout the song, I find it distracting; a shame considering there is a killer song to be heard here.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Almost Home (Blisko Domu)</strong> is sonically stunning and is a song that I could listen to for hours on repeat.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>We A Family</strong>, as the final song on <em>Oczy Mlody</em> closes the album out nicely while paying homage to the songs and creativity that has come before it. Even if you decide not to listen to the album again, We A Family will stick with you and ultimately become a memorable musical experience.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While I haven’t liked every album The Flaming Lips have released, I’m overjoyed that <em>Oczy Mlody </em>isn’t amongst them for it is sonically pleasing and thoroughly enjoyable even if the lyrical meanings remain aloof. It just goes to prove that one needn’t like every album from an artist to be a fan of their work.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1623221299411_85159"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/index">Check out more reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1623221299411_86091"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Music like this is the epitome of subjectivity and it’s thoroughly relaxing. Without a doubt, it’s one of the best interpretations on <em>Piano</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Aldrig&nbsp;</strong>is a lovely song, but I feel it’s positioned badly as it’s musically different to You And I and Thank You For The Music, thereby creating a less than cohesive album experience.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Thank You For The Music&nbsp;</strong>is legendary, but this recording sounds as though it could have been played in any piano bar. It doesn’t mar the album, but one can’t help but wonder if a slightly more stylised interpretation wouldn’t have yielded a better result. The accompanying <a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/music-video/thank-you-for-the-music/1467909605?itsct=music_box_link&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1&amp;app=music"><span style="text-decoration:underline">music video</span></a>, however, appeals to me as it showcases not only Andersson performing the song but takes us on a visual history of Andersson’s creative endeavours.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Stockholm By Night&nbsp;</strong>is breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Chess&nbsp;</strong>is a modern-day masterpiece. Amazing!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Day Before You Came&nbsp;</strong>is performed flawlessly. The soundstage is immersive as the piano fills your space, captivating you from the very first note, in a musical presentation that has to be heard to be believed.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Someone Else’s Story&nbsp;</strong>is another beautiful selection from <em>Chess</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Midnattsdans&nbsp;</strong>is a lovely interpretation from&nbsp;<em>BAO!</em>, the second album from <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/au/artist/benny-anderssons-orkester/263977757?mt=1&amp;app=music&amp;at=1l3vtbU">Benny Anderssons Orkester</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Målarskolan&nbsp;</strong>is a little more upbeat when compared to the rest of the songs featured on Piano, but it works flawlessly within the album structure.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Wonder (Departure)&nbsp;</strong>is magnificent! I’d even go as far as suggesting that this rendition greatly improves on the gem that was already present on ABBA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://geo.music.apple.com/us/album/i-wonder-departure/1440821028?i=1440821404&amp;itsct=music_box_link&amp;itscg=30200&amp;at=1l3vtbU&amp;ls=1&amp;app=music"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>The Album</em></span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Embassy Lament&nbsp;</strong>is enjoyable but isn’t to the same standard as the rest of the songs on&nbsp;<em>Piano.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Anthem&nbsp;</strong>is such a delicate composition that it never ceases to amaze.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>My Love, My Life&nbsp;</strong>is one of my all-time favourite ABBA songs and this rendition only enhances my feelings about this song. Spectacular!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Mountain Duet&nbsp;</strong>is quite an interesting composition. It sounds fully developed, yet it also feels incomplete. I know that makes no sense, but there are multiple ways one could appreciate this song and despite having heard it many times, I’m not really sure how, or if, I connect with Mountain Duet.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Flickornas Rum&nbsp;</strong>is a great tune that I thoroughly enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Efter Regnet&nbsp;</strong>has me closing my eyes as I picture Andersson playing a private performance for me, and only me. The recording is so transparent, however, that you too will experience that feeling.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tröstevisa&nbsp;</strong>is an absolutely beautiful song.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>En Skrift I Snön&nbsp;</strong>is tranquilly exquisite.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Happy New Year&nbsp;</strong>was a lovely song when released by ABBA on&nbsp;<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/au/album/happy-new-year/840607020?i=840607038&amp;mt=1&amp;app=music&amp;at=1l3vtbU"><em>Super Trouper</em></a>, but I much prefer this rendition to the original.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I Gott Bevar&nbsp;</strong>is a perfect song to close the album on as it encourages me to listen again.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Overall,&nbsp;<em>Piano </em>is one of the greatest pieces of music Andersson has ever released and it deserves a place in everyone’s collection.</p></div></div><div class="sqs-block markdown-block sqs-block-markdown" data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1622163748424_205073"><div class="sqs-block-content"><p data-preserve-html-node="true"><a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://www.subjectivesounds.com/index">Check out more reviews by Subjective Sounds</a></p></div></div><div class="sqs-block code-block sqs-block-code" data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1622163748424_206455"><div class="sqs-block-content"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
