We’ve chosen to spotlight a group of international designers whose work defines their respective fields and is heavily influenced by their unique perspectives as Queer creators. Each designer has been illustrated by Spanish artist, José Roda, whose work also appears on our Shave with Pride set.<br/><br/><strong>Design with Pride</strong> celebrates the exceptional talents and personalities of those in the LGBTQ design community – we hope you find inspiration as you explore the gallery, and encourage you to share your own story.</p></div><div class="wall_container__KfZHS

Adam Curry (former MTV video jockey and radio broadcaster) and software developer Dave Winer created the first ever podcast in 2004 when they wrote a program they called iPodder. The program allowed Curry and Winer to download automatically Internet radio broadcasts to their iPods. They could then take their iPods, along with their broadcasts, anywhere. The actual term “podcasting” appeared shortly thereafter in the 2004 article by Ben Hammersley that was published in The Guardian. While much of the early podcasting software wasn’t user-friendly, the first commercially successful Software was created by August Trometer and Ray Slakinski. First called iPodderX, Trometer and Slakinski later changed the name to Transistr, and an industry was born. In June 2005, Apple added podcasting to the iTunes 4.9 software and built a directory of podcasts in iTunes. Here listeners could both subscribe and listen to podcasts. As soon as I read about this new technology, I decided to upload my brand new recorded Design Matters files to iTunes, inadvertently making Design Matters the first-ever design podcast to be distributed in this manner. The ultimate democratic endeavor, podcasting is (at least for now) free from government regulation. Podcasters don’t need a license to broadcast programming (radio stations do) and they aren’t required to conform to the United States Federal Communication Commission decency regulations. Anything and everything is allowed in podcasting, and this leniency is leveraged all over the Internet. In the last ten years the technology has changed, as has the landscape of podcasting. Once a frantic free-for-all, podcasting is now a worldwide phenomenon. I started planning Design Matters in 2004 and launched it online in 2005. Since that time, Design Matters has evolved from a show about designers talking about design to a show about how the worlds most creative people design their lives."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"0d99810802f4","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"0d99810802f40","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Branding is often overlooked or ignored by the general public, but is such a crucial part of our world.

And it’s easy to fall into this mode of thinking. Agencies, marketing departments, public relations, and media are all businesses themselves, caught up in an echo chamber of brands. Brands promote other brands, partner with other brands, buy other brands, and have appropriated the symbolism of other brands.

And if you aren't successful right out of the gate, there must be something wrong with you.

If you are one of the few souls in the world that are actually able to hit it out of the ballpark before you are 30, you might want to consider how you are going to be able to sustain that success over the long term. The pressure to keep succeeding over and over will mount and you will likely feel that you must only hit the home runs. This is impossible.\nTake your time and build your skills. Refine your methodology over time and give yourself the opportunity to grow and develop. Use your twenties to experiment. This is a time when falling flat on your face is expected.

Simply put: you don’t find the time to do something; you make the time to do things. We are now living in a society that sees busy as a badge. It has become cultural cache to use the excuse “I am too busy,” as a reason for not doing anything we don’t feel like doing.
